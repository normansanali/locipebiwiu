Along with Ramsay’s well-documented cooking prowess and expertise, the British chef is joined in the reality series by fellow chefs Richard Blais and Nyesha Arrington.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Flash forward to 2024, and the buzz surrounding the face-melting cooking experience has yet to waver, with aspiring chefs, reality series supporters, and regular civilians all wondering about what the third season will bring to the chef’s table — and it’s clearly already off to a hot start.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-plot-of-season-3-of-next-level-chef data-injectable=false>What is the plot of season 3 of Next Level Chef?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/next-level-chef.png><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>Unlike a typical television series, Next Level Chef doesn’t adhere to the rules and restrictions of a regular show. Instead, the series follows a similar path of reality series, where all chefs are competing for a chance at a paid mentorship under all three main chefs in Ramsay, Arrington, and Blais. In the third season thus far, the group of contestants have been split up into three parts as the home chefs, social media chefs, and professional chefs — all of whom are competing for that larger-than-life mentorship.</p><h2 id=h-when-does-season-3-of-next-level-chef-release data-injectable=false>When does season 3 of Next Level Chef release?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Luckily, eagle-eyed viewers of the acclaimed show didn’t have to wait too long before indulging in the new season, with the third venture of the series releasing on Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024 at 10 pm ET / 7 pm PT. The past two seasons have featured the first episode of the season premiering on a Sunday, so it makes perfect sense as to why season 3 decided to continue with this tradition — with the first episode of the second season even premiering right after Super Bowl LVII last year.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>After its special premiere on the 28th, the rest of the episodes for the third season will now air Thursdays on Fox at 8 pm ET. So even if you have unfortunately missed the first three episodes of the show, episodes of the show are available to stream on Hulu the next day, which would be a Friday.</p><h2 id=h-who-are-the-contestants-for-season-3 data-injectable=false>Who are the contestants for season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mac-And-Cheese-TikTok.jpg><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>In the past, fan-favorite contestants such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok chef Tineke “Tini” Younger</a> have made a big splash with fans of the series. And with the new season just landing on Fox a few weeks ago, it’s understandable why Next Level Chef die-hards are wondering about all the chefs involved in the brand-new season of the intense competition.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=false>As previously mentioned, the chefs in this season have been split into three different sections for the first three episodes of the show, which have been described as the “auditions.” That said, the fourth episode, which airs tonight, is set to serve as a “draft” of chefs for Ramsay, Blais, and Arrington to select from for their own teams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdetZKWdppq5bq%2FHnp1mq5WWwLC6jGxkq52cmq60sYydmK2dXZi8r8DErKuapqSoeqK6w2akqKqVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
