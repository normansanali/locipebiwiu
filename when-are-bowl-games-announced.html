There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">43 different bowls</a> overall and some of them are established for different reasons.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For one, the Tailgreeter Cure Bowl was founded to help fight against breast cancer. There was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Kimmel L.A. Bowl</a> (which has since been replaced with the L.A. Bowl Hosted by Gronk) and a Tropical Smoothie Cafe Frisco Bowl. Although some of them were founded for more serious reasons, others began to share the spirit of the season or to share the love a certain area has for football.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Auto Zone Liberty Bowl</a> states that aside from sharing a love of football with others, its mission is to help raise money for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and to economically support the surrounding community.
