Despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Throne of Glass</a> and A Court of Thorns and Roses being her best-known book series, though, there is a fairly recent collection quickly gaining attention — <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crescent City</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>The first book of the bunch, House of Earth and Blood, was published in 2020 and since then, readers just can’t get enough. The story follows Bryce Quinlan, a half-human half-fae, on her quest to avenge the murder of her best friend. In the process of discovering how the plot unfolds, though, readers also get to explore a new, fantastical world, full of magical creatures. This is everything that any fantasy fan could ask for, so it’s no wonder that folks have gotten so invested in the story.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Currently, there are three books in the Crescent City series, with the latest having been released on Jan. 30, 2024. After the cliffhanger that the second installment left us with, anticipation for House of Flame and Shadow was at an all-time high, as folks prepared to see how Bryce would fare in another world. (Especially when it’s a world featured in another of Maas’ book series.) At last, the book arrived, but those who have already devoured its content are asking for more. Will they get it, though?</p><h2 id=h-will-crescent-city-have-a-fourth-book data-injectable=false>Will Crescent City have a fourth book?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sarah-j-mass-crescent-city.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Yes, there will be a fourth book in the Crescent City series. As most fans probably know by now, when Sarah J. Maas started this particular adventure, she planned for it to be a trilogy. However, to the delight of avid readers, it seems like she has changed her mind.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>In an interview for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY</a>, the author confirmed that there is more to come after House of Flame and Shadow, but warned that we’ll have to be patient. Although Maas has big ideas for the fourth book and already decided which character it will focus on, it will take a while for it to come out. If the release dates for other books in this series are anything to go by, we may be looking at a two-year wait, but considering that the author also has other projects going on, it may take even longer.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Regardless of when the fourth installment is published, what matters is that the journey will continue. And of course, that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BookTokers</a> can now rest easy, knowing that they’ll have more to talk about in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeSpLysv46woKWkXam1pr7EZpmeZZGjvLW0xKtknKqVqLCmutNmmqKsqWKvsLvKaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
