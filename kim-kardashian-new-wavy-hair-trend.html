The celebrity became known for her perfectly spiralized waves, the type that appear like they've just unwound from a curling wand. Our copycat attempts followed, as did thousands of blowout bars across the country. But Kim Kardashian isn't nearly done making <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>beauty</a> trends happen, and according to her hairstylist, she's about to kick off another major wave movement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kardashian can't be solely credited to making <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wavy hair</a> happen, the airy, textured way she's wearing hers now could very well be the next generation of waves, explains her hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Chris Appleton</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like Kim’s wave is the new generation of waves," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a>. "Because we’ve had the glam wave. For so long we’ve had the bedhead wave, but her wave is somewhere in-between the two."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BG017/Bauer-Griffin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He's referencing the subtle movement that makes her look like she has a fan on her at all times. "It’s definitely the new generation of wave because it’s in-between. It still has a touch of glamour, but it's not too classic. I think that’s why it feels good—because it’s just right. It’s cool, sexy girl, but you feel done as well. It’s not just like the 'don’t care hair' because it’s just bedhead. It’s more done than that, but it’s not as done as a 'do," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Cost of Getting Your Hair Dyed</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That means your texturizing sprays and curling wands are going to get a lot more action in 2018. We don't have Appleton's breakdown, but we've tried out own hand at recreating Kardashian's look. After rough-drying hair, we recommend adding in very loose waves with a curling iron or a wand. Using your fingers, gently pull down on the curls, separating any ringlets. Finally, spritz in a texturizing spray like Color Wow Texture and Finish Spray ($24; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>colorwowhair.com</a>). This will give it the volume and a piece-y vibe without being too messy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This perfect mixture of body and texture is what Appleton expects to replace the sleek Cher Hair trend that celebrities like Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato adopted. "2018 will be about more volume and body and bringing sexy back into the hair," he told InStyle. "I think 2018 will definitely be the year of changing it up."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Use that as your excuse to make a salon appointment before heading back to work on January 2nd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2ebnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nNnq5mr5Grxm60wKKpZqyimrul</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
