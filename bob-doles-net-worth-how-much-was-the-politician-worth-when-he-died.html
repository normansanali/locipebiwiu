Dole was elected to serve Kansas in the United States House of Representatives in 1960, then served as a U.S. Senator from 1969 until 1996. He earned $148,000 as a senator and earned $10,000 a year in speaking fees and nearly $20,000 in military benefits. Dole ran for president three times, winning the GOP nomination in 1996, but losing to <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a>.</p><p>After leaving the Senate, Dole earned significantly more money working as a <a href=#>consultant and lobbyist</a> for the healthcare, aviation, banking, and insurance industries. But the former farm boy from Kansas could never quite leave public service behind. <a href=#>USA Today</a> reported that Dole served as an envoy to Serbia for President Clinton and raised millions to help build the World War II memorial unveiled in 2004. According to USA Today, Dole was concerned about polarization in the United States. He said, "I can't get my hand on it, but we're just not quite where we should be, as the greatest democracy in the world. And I don't know how you correct it, but I keep hoping that there will be a change in my lifetime."</p><p>A former member of Dole's staff told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> that many of the Kansas senator's contributions were made outside the spotlight. The staffer said, "People never just knew what Bob Dole achieved late at night in the Senate."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29oZn52e8GomWacn6GytHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5x6iuZqWlmLVuw8CsZK2glWK9sLjIraCcoZGjeri70a2fZq%2BYmrtutMRmm6KdlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
