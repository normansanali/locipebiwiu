Recommended Videos During its final few months, the year 2023 defined itself as the hot time for celebrities who you thought were in stable relationships to shout “Psych!” and reveal that they’d actually been separated for years. Will and Jada did it. Then Meryl Streep blew some minds by letting interviewers know that she and Don Gummer, her husband since 1978, had split back in 2017."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then Meryl Streep blew some minds by letting interviewers know that she and Don Gummer, her husband since 1978, had split back in 2017. At this point, it’s only a matter of time until we find out that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson haven’t spoken since the premiere of Turner & Hooch.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>But today’s not about Turner or Hooch.

Together with Streep, Gummer owns a home in Pasadena and a 90-acre property in Connecticut. Additionally, the estranged duo have bought and sold over $25 million in real estate over the last 30 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZSku26z1KaknqqjYrumwIywpqusmGK2r3mRaWlsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
