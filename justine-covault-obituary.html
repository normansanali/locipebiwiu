Covault’s daughter Haley posted a notification on Facebook on Friday (June 9) afternoon about her deἀth.</p><p><strong>Her main cause of deἀth is unknown yet. </strong>Covault, a native of Detroit who now resides in Arlington was a dedicated supporter of the Boston music scene in his roles as a musician with bands including Justine & The Unclean and Justine’s Black Threads event organizer and record label owner with Red On Red Records.</p><p>After only a few short years, the New England-based independent label became a major outlet for power-pop, punk, alt-rock, indie rock and Americana. The loss of Covault is devἀstating to Boston’s music scene. Lane writes:</p><p>“Shock and grief, Justine Covault is no longer with us. Makes no logic at all. Lots of broken hearts. Red On Red Records was her baby and she ran it like a tight ship for her bands Justine and The Unclean. She helped numerous Boston bands get their music out on CDs and digital albums. What a pathetic defeat.”</p><p>Tim Sprague of Crow Follow adds:</p><p>“We’ve all lost an ally and a creative force who worked to lift us all up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Justine-Covault-.jpg><p>Many people’s sentiments are expressed by photographer Coleman Rogers in his statement:</p><p>“The Boston music scene has lost someone really special. Give those you love a hug.”</p><p>Justine Covault was a talented musician, but she was also a mentor and an icon in the Boston music community. She actively participated in the industry as a musician and a performance promoter making substantial contributions to it.</p><p>Covault became a well-liked character because of her consistent support for the neighborhood’s music scene. Justine left a lasting impression on the music business as the creator and proprietor of Red On Red Records.</p><p>Her own record company which specialized in the power-pop, punk, alt-rock, indie-rock and Americana genres immediately attracted attention on a global scale.</p><p>The Chelsea Curve, Linnea’s Garden, Andrea Gillis and other great musicians were featured by Red On Red Records which grew to be a significant platform for New England music.</p><p><strong>Read about the obituary of other peoples who recently pἀssed away in the posts below:</strong></p><p><strong>On social media, many are expressing condolences for Justine Covault:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Overwhelmed by the sudden loss of beautiful Justine Covault.
