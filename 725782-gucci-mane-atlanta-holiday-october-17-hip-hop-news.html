The video stuck out to so many people because Gucci is notorious for cosigning almost anyone. Thankfully, in the comments of the clip many stuck up for the rapper in the video and told him to continue grinding.</p><p>While Gucci hasn't been quite as prolific as usual recently he did drop two major compilations recently. Together they combine to an impressive amount of material, more than 100 songs. They were framed as the conclusion to his ongoing Icy Boyz series, which also includes his last studio album in 2021.
