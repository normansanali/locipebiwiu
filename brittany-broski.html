There is pressure to keep up. Every video needs to be better than the last. There is also the pressure to be nice to every single person you met, even when you’re having a bad day.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-38235 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Brittany-Broski-presenting-awards-at-Streamys-2019.jpg alt="Brittany Broski" width=650 height=809 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-38235 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Brittany Broski presenting an award at the 2019 Streamys.
