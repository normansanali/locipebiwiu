This theory echoes a statement made by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC News Now</a>&nbsp;Meteorologist Damon Matson. When asked about the dust he said:&nbsp;</p><p>“This is likely dust from the desert southwest, a very strong storm system causing all the wintry weather across the northern U.S. and severe weather in the southern U.S. It picked up the dust on the back side of the storm and dragged it across the country. The dust remained elevated in the atmosphere as the storm remained strong.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Another theory suggested that it was ashes from a local wildfire, with one comment noting, “That looks like ashes from a huge fire…might have blown their way…I know wildfires bring ashes from afar.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Other users argued it was, “The white stuff that they put out big fires,” with many wondering if it might have been used on the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and blown across.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Of course, many users decided to revive a classic conspiracy theory and alleged that the dust was dropped by planes. One user posted that: “I live in ohio we have been having lots of jets leaving chem trails!! we have pics.” While another said:</p><p>“My friend in Maryland saw a small plane dropping white dust this morning. Something weird’s going on.”</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Some believed the dust storm was the latest and greatest marketing stunt ever, arguing that the team behind&nbsp;Cocaine Bear&nbsp;was dropping white powder to get people interested in the film. One comment summed this up by saying:</p><p>“That one movie really want to advertise it.”</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>However, the most common reply suggested that the dust was snow, and the locals were unfamiliar with the wintery concept. One user succinctly and hilariously posted:</p><p>“Bro just discovered snow.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArapmrJiaeq7F0q2cq6GfqsBuw8eiq55llKrAtXnFmqOloZ6ceqe%2BzqZkraCVYsCsxYytoKSsn6B6qa3SZqqopZVitqWxwKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
