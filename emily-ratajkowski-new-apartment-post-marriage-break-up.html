The large sofa frames a dark green coffee table with a striking marbled effect and flanks white walls showcasing some modern artworks. A poster displaying a body-positive quote immediately catches the eye, in addition to a sizeable abstract painting. Towering plants sit beside the beautiful sofa and opposite sits a modern wooden chair with unusual circular cut-out detailing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ccfd4057907-em-rata-mirror-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebWmmrQuiVZR data-wc=6><strong>Emily's living room is modestly furnished</strong></p><p id=eXvEkOPMGvDK data-wc=47>In the corner of the living room stands a large three-fold mirror – ideal for selfie-taking.

From fiction to non-fiction reads, Emily is clearly proud of her rows of books which are peppered with photo frames and delicate ornaments.

The model revealed that she's currently sleeping on a mattress on the floor – how very contemporary – which looks onto a white chest of drawers and another painterly oil artwork portraying a dark-haired woman doing her makeup in the mirror. Another tall mirror rests beside the chest of drawers which reflects Emily's crisp white bedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a2c7801690f2-em-rata-bed-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eiqWOqtaEf35 data-wc=6><strong>Emily showed off her minimalist bedroom</strong></p><p id=eLa-Bk7gS55- data-wc=22>Emily <a class=hm-link href=#>sold her previous Los Angeles home for $2.5 million - a house that she shared with her ex Sebastian.</a> Her new house certainly echoes the style of the author's former residence, yet there are pieces she has seemingly left behind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88e598f84123-em-reata-old-home-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=en1BXqT5pRu9 data-wc=10><strong>Emily kept the sage green sofa from her old apartment</strong></p><p id=eRLaFbujzzXl data-wc=54>Shortly after the couple had originally moved into their west coast house, model Emily shared a look at one of the living rooms.
