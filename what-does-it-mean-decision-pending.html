The ‘decision in process’ status implies that your manuscript has passed through peer review and the editorial board is now making a decision.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-the-decision-process-take></span>How long does the decision process take?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The duration of decision making may range from a month to four years, but <b>usually takes about 12 months</b>. Most processes run into disruptions and interruptions, which lengthen the time taken. Measuring decision making is difficult since it is virtually impossible to define the beginning and end of the process.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-ready-for-decision-mean></span>What does ready for decision mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer: When the status for a manuscript changes “Under Review” to “Ready for Decision”, it means that <b>the peer-review process is complete and only the editorial decision is pending</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-is-pnas-review></span>How long is PNAS review?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>On average, a full review takes just <b>45 days</b>, and most articles publish within 6 months of submission.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-under-editor-review-mean-pnas></span>What does under editor review mean PNAS?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If satisfied, the AE sends the paper <b>for peer review</b>, denoted by ‘Under Review. ‘ Once the paper has come back from the reviewers, the AE goes through their comments to arrive at a decision on the paper, denoted by ‘Under Editor Evaluation’ or, as in this case, ‘Under Editor Review.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-a-direct-decision-in-process-status-indicate-rejection></span>Does a direct decision in process status indicate rejection?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Normally, a direct change from “With editor” to “Decision in process” implies a <b>desk rejection</b>. You have not mentioned whether your paper has been through any other status before this.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-after-va-claim-closed-will-i-get-paid></span>How long after VA claim closed will I get paid?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If your decision notice shows at least a 10% disability rating, you’ll get your first payment <b>within 15 days</b>. We’ll pay you either by direct deposit or check. If you don’t get a payment after 15 days, please call the Veterans help line at 800-827-1000, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-the-va-closed-my-claim></span>Why did the VA closed my claim?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Your Supplemental Claim was closed<p>We closed your Supplemental Claim.

I’m guessing that the editor-in-chief disagreed with the editor, and either assigned a different editor or sent the manuscript back to the editor.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-desk-rejection></span>What is desk rejection?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A desk-reject means <b>your manuscript has been rejected by a journal without being sent out for review</b>. … So for many academics a desk-reject causes extreme disappointment, a feeling that can easily change to desperation if this same outcome is repeated over and over again.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-it-mean-decision-in-process-after-under-review></span>What does it mean decision in process after under review?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The status “Decision in process” after “Under review” means that <b>all the reviews have come in and the editor is evaluating your paper based on the reviewer’s comments</b>. After going through the reviewers’ comments, the editor will make a decision about your manuscript. There can be four possible outcomes: Accept.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-editors-decision-in-process-mean></span>What does editor’s decision in process mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Decision in Process:<p>This means that <b>the editor is now taking a decision on your paper based on the peer reviewer comments and his/her own opinion</b>. If required, the editor may consult the editorial board at this stage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-paper-be-rejected-after-major-revision></span>Can a paper be rejected after major revision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer: Unfortunately, <b>sometimes manuscript do get rejected after the second or even third round of revisions</b>. This can happen due to multiple reasons such as: The authors might not have adequately addressed all the questions raised by the reviewers.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-paper-be-rejected-after-minor-revision></span>Can a paper be rejected after minor revision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Sometimes a revised manuscript goes out to a new reviewer, so although the minor revisions may have been done in a thorough manner, the new may identify other issues with the manuscript, which might result in a recommendation to reject.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-editor-decision-start-mean></span>What does editor decision Start mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The status ‘Decision started’ indicates <b>that the peer review process for your manuscript is complete and the paper is now with the editor</b>. The editor is probably going through the reviews to arrive at a decision. Hopefully, you will be informed of the decision soon.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-awaiting-editor-in-chief-decision-mean></span>What does awaiting editor-in-chief decision mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Editor-in-Chief (EiC) makes <b>the final decision on manuscript</b>, with the associate editor (AE) making the initial decision. … So, the present status may mean that the EiC now needs to make a decision based on the peer review comments or on the revised manuscript.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-under-review-mean-springer></span>What does under review mean Springer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>I sent a manuscript to Springer. The <b>status appears</b> as ‘Under Review. … If the manuscript clears the internal check, it will be sent for peer review. If however there were status updates before this one (such as for the internal check), the manuscript has been sent for peer review.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMoqtmpZWWu26wxJygrKGfo3qxsc2doKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
