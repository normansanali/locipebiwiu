The mod isn’t perfect since screenshots show that the broom’s end can still be seen protruding out from behind, but that can be easily ignored if you just focus on the fact that you’re riding a sentient train.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Thomasbroom.jpg><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>According to the mod’s description, there are still some clipping and culling issues but they decided to release the mod in its current state for now.

Half of them were ideas about how far this mod could go. Some suggested a mod that “increases the brooms speed to that of a locomotive,” while others suggested other notable train-based and pop culture vehicles to be added to the game.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, don’t expect the rest of Thomas’s friends to enter Hogwarts since the mod features Thomas only. But since the game was fully released only recently, perhaps Percy, James, Gordon, and the gang would make their wizarding debut in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdoprAbq3Lq5yanKlirm7Ax6ikmqtdqbWmedOapaRllaO0qrrEZqSonF2bvLN5x6iesJmiqcBuuMSgmJyxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
