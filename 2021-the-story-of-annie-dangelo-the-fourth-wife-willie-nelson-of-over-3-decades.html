The former make-up artist has received credits for being instrumental in her husband’s current stable life after hitting several rocky relationships.</p><p>Annie D’Angelo retired from her career as a makeup artist and many wonder what she makes out of her life aside from being the wife of a country singer. Here are facts to know about her personal and professional life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-annie-dangelo></span><strong>Who is Annie D’Angelo?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Annie celebrates her birthday every 27th of August but her birth year is not known. A lot more information about her childhood years as well as her parents and educational background has been completely hidden from the public view. Annie holds an American nationality and her ethnicity is white.</p><p>Annie D’Angelo started off as a makeup artist and she is known for working for several production companies in the late 1980s. According to some sources, she helped in the productions of films like Gleaming The Cube, Bachelor Party, The Rosary Murders, and many more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-family-life></span><strong>Her Family Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Annie D’Angelo became a public figure immediately after her marriage to Willie Hugh Nelson, a man whose name is synonymous with country music but who’s marital life has capsized severally.</p><p>Annie’s marriage to Nelson is apparently her first as she has not been linked to any man as her boyfriend or husband. However, she is her husband’s fourth wife as he has been previously married to three other women before her. Willie married his first wife, Martha Matthews in 1952, unfortunately, the marriage lasted for only ten years after which they were separated. The country singer had three children with his first estranged wife.</p><p>Shortly after Willie and Matha’s separation, the Texas-born country singer hooked up with Shirey Collie. They married in 1963, only to divorce after living together as a couple for eight years. Collie filed for divorce after discovering her husband’s marital affairs with Connie Koepke which resulted in the birth of a female child named Paula Carlene Nelson.</p><p>Willie and Collie officially separated in 1971 and the same year, he went ahead to marry his third wife, Connie Koepke. The American icon welcomed another female child with Koepke named Amy Lee Nelson before calling it quits in 1988. Annie D’Angelo and Willie tied the knot in 1991 at Nashville’s St. Alouin Church and they have been living together as husband and wife since then. They are also blessed with two children namely&nbsp;Lukas Nelson and Micah Nelson.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-money-does-she-have></span><strong>How Much Money Does She Have?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As one who has been up and doing in her career as a makeup artist, there is no doubt that Annie has accumulated a huge sum for herself. Her roles in the productions of films fall among her major sources of income. However, she has not revealed just how much she earned as a makeup artist but even as a housewife, she must have a share from her husband’s $25 million net worth. The American country music singer-songwriter who is also known as an author, poet and actor, generated much of his net worth from his singing career which he started at the age of seven.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-she-met-willie-nelson></span><strong>How she met Willie Nelson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>There is no doubt that Annie is enjoying a blissful marriage with her husband, Winnie. She met her husband on the set of the 1986 film,&nbsp; Stagecoach. At that time, she was working as a makeup artist for the film while her husband was still married to his third wife, Connie Koepke. When Annie became Winnie’s wife, she helped managed the singer’s financial life which resulted in his lesser payrolls.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-sons-are-into-music></span><strong>Her Sons are Into Music</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Country music icon and his wife have been able to raise children who have a passion for the music industry like their father. Annie’s two sons Lukas Autrey (born December 25, 1988) and Jacob Micah (May 24, 1990) are both musicians. Lucas began his music career in early 2000 but he is often seen on musical tour with his father. He wrote his first song at the age of 11 and by the age of 13 he was already playing rhythm guitar with his father’s musical band group. The young musician is currently working with a music band known as Promise of the Real (POTR).</p><p>Micah is also into music and his musical style is unconventional and futuristic. He has a band named Insects Vs. Robots where he incorporates his visual art with his music including paintings, films and animation. Winnie and the boys have even released an album known as Willie Nelson and the Boys. Micah owns a site known as micahnelson.com.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=annies-step-children></span><strong>Annie’s Step Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aside from her two adorable boys, Annie takes care of her husband’s children from his previous marriages.
