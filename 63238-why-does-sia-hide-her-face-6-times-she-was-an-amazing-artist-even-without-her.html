While I fully appreciate <a href=# class=T3D>Kristen Wiig dancing it out to "Chandelier,"</a> it's interesting that we never actually see <i>Sia</i> perform. So, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>why doesn't Sia show her face</a>? She explained everything in an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>"anti-fame manifesto" for <i>Billboard</i></a> in 2013, likening the critics on the internet to awful mother-in-laws who constantly tell you you're ugly or not good enough. She also spoke to <i>Dateline</i>'s Chris Connelly about <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>why she doesn't want to be in the spotlight</a> herself. "I don’t want to be famous, or recognizable. I don’t want to be critiqued about the way that I look on the Internet … I’ve been writing pop songs for pop stars for a couple years and see what their lives are like and that’s just not something I want."</p><p>But now that you know why Sia hides her face, you probably want to know what she really looks like. She doesn't hide herself in public like how Shia LaBeouf walked around with a paper bag on his head. She smiles for the cameras at parties, goes out on some red carpets with her husband, and doesn't wear her wig out and about in LA. In fact, before she achieved mega-stardom, she used to perform and give interviews all the time while showing her face. I've rounded up six times she faced the cameras below to give you a better idea of what she's really like, because she doesn't actually need that wig to be an amazing artist.</p><h3>Performing "Breathe Me" in 2007</h3><p></p><p>She has giggly fun with the crowd and delivers a killer performance. Her hair is really short here — it's not a wig.</p><h3>Posing With Her Husband At The <i>Annie</i> Premiere</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Theo Wargo/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The <a href=# class=T3D>love letter that Shia LaBeouf read onstage at the Grammys</a> was reportedly from her real-life husband, Erik Anders Lang. How cute is that?</p><h3>Talking About Her Adorable Dogs in 2010</h3><p></p><p>Ironically, this interview was with an outlet called Face Culture, and Sia talked about having her dogs on tour so she doesn't feel lonely.</p><h3>Singing "Titanium" in 2013</h3><p></p><p>Her signature blond bob is here, but she showed her face for this performance at "An Evening With Women" at the LA Gay & Lesbian Center.</p><h3>Advising With Christina Aguilera On <i>The Voice</i></h3><p></p><p>During <i>The Voice</i> Season 1, Sia was a trusted adviser, giving great advice to contestants.</p><h3>Hanging Out At The 2015 Grammys</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Larry Busacca/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Even though she <a href=# class=T3D>disguised herself with giant hair on the red carpet</a> with Ziegler, she looked totally normal inside the ceremony itself for this fun snap with Pharrell Williams.</p><p><i>Images: Getty Images</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx3f5Fsb2avmK56pbvErGSsoZFitaqwxGafnqpdm66ksYxvZK2hnZrAbr%2FHnmSwmaNirq95wKaYs6GenHqivtOiqq1llauyr3nWoquhp6Wpeqmx0Q%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
