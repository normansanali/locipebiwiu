He was a married man with kids, and ironically worked for ADT Security Services, installing alarms which people wanted to install because they feared him.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>He even was elected president of his church council and also served as a cub scout leader. There is a lot of information out there about Rader, and it can be hard to differentiate one from another. That’s where we come in: we’ve sifted through the seemingly hundreds of podcasts, documentaries and movies about the killer to only bring you the very best. Before that, let’s do a summary of the man and his history to help with context.</p><h2 id=h-who-was-the-btk-killer data-injectable=false>Who was the BTK Killer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-59.png><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>In case you’re curious as to what the heck’s going on in the above photo, it’s a selfie police found in side Dennis Rader’s home. He liked to dress up in his victim’s clothes and underwear, tie himself up and take photos. But let’s start at the beginning.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Rader aka the BTK killer murdered 10 people between 1974 and 1991. He was born in Wichita, Kansas, and when he was a child, he murdered and dismembered animals and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nurtured sick fantasies</a> about bondage and rape.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>He served in the Air Force in the ’60s and by 1970 he was back in Wichita with a wife and two children. He committed his first murders on January 15, 1974 – strangling four family members, two of them children.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Later that year, Rader murdered a 21-year-old woman by stabbing her. He left a note in a library book in the Wichita State Library saying that “the code words for me will be…bind them, torture them, kill them, B.T.K.”</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>He killed five more women over the next twenty years, but grew frustrated by the lack of media coverage. He wrote a letter to a local TV station and said “How many people do I have to kill before I get a name in the paper or some national attention?” This subsequently set off a panic.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>He didn’t murder again for eight years, and his last murder was a 62-year-old woman. All the cases eventually went cold. In 2004, he started sending packages to media and leaving things around Wichita. In 2005, police recovered a cereal box sent by Rader (cereal – serial) that asked if police would be able to trace a floppy disk he sent.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>They said it was safe and he stupidly sent it and was caught when the disk traced back to his local church where he was the president.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Essential BTK Podcasts, Movies and Documentaries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-5.png><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>One of the most fascinating things about the BTK killer is that he pretty much got away with everything except in the end his ego got him.
