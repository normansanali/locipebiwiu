We’ve been doing this for 10 years so this is giving us a whole other dynamic in our relationship and I’m excited to see [what happens],” Vanessa, 36, exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i> last week. “I’m proud of us for doing it together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maks-chmerkovskiy-490454b3-4075-4a2f-b89a-e0c0763408ac.jpg><p>The Lacheys did a spouse swap for the ABC show’s 25th season. While Vanessa is teamed with <a href=#><b>Maks Chmerkovskiy</b></a>, Nick, 43, is partnered with the Ukrainian hunk’s wife, <a href=#><b>Peta Murgatroyd</b></a>.</p><p>“We don’t practice dancing with each other but it is nice because of the massages,” Vanessa told <i>Us</i>. “I’m like, I’ll rub your feet you rub my feet. That is fun. It really is another layer to our relationship. I can’t wait for the first live show, and I can’t to watch him. We did a little show the other day, we were at the same studio, and Maks and I came in and they showed us a little bit of their routine and we showed them a little bit of what we learned.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/peta-murgatroyd-nick-lachey-fe568c33-6552-4dc5-8052-7b2e0dd7b5d6.jpg><p>She added: “It would be fun if we all made it to the finals.”</p><p>Vanessa admitted that she doesn’t really enjoy the gym, though. Luckily, Chmerkovskiy, 37, has no intention of pushing her to the extreme like her past “intense trainers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“It kind of seems childish. You have these grownups come, they signed on to do a show. It’s not like we’re in a summer camp together, and here I am making them do warmups and pushups and all that. It’s not me man,” he told <i>Us</i>. “I want to do my best and I want her to do her best too so we can do our thing. When I speed things up faster and faster, I know that there’s a leg that is able to do it. What is the point of pushing someone that I know for a fact that some of these people cannot be pushed? If you push, it’s going to break, and nobody wants that.”</p><p>Season 25 of <i>DWTS </i>premieres on Monday, September 28, on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appWowKJ5y5qaoZ2pYruqr8pmmKecXZ56qLXVnmSemZOderDAx56pZqWRqMCis8SsZJqepJq%2FbrDWrapmqKKWsLW1wp5ksG1gZ4F4fo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
