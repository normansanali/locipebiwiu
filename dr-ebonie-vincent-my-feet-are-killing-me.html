Here’s what we learned about the gifted and gorgeous foot and ankle expert.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Dr. Ebonie Vincent from 'My Feet Are Killing Me' married?</h2><p>The surgeon doesn’t share a lot of details about her personal life on her website or social media, but she appears to be single — though plenty of people would love to see her and Dr. Brad get together! One fan noted that they make the otherwise unbearable show bearable.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"That’s why they hired two of the most gorgeous foot doctors on earth," the Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>.

"My answer to this question is always the same; disease of any kind is not pretty."&nbsp;</p><p>She adds, "It takes a special heart and a strong stomach at times to handle problems with the feet and to help to get patients back on their feet. Podiatry care is something that can literally change people’s lives for the better!"</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Present Podiatry</a>, Ebonie revealed that she first heard about her new TLC gig from an office manager at the practice she works for, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange County Podiatry</a>.
