It is routinely filled with the best options the game has to offer. It also routinely changes them. At any given moment, there’s a good chance of a few things:<p>First, that there will be brand new skins that no one has purchased before and second, that there will be skins that weren’t there the last time you logged in and checked the shop.</p><p>This may seem random, but it’s not. It functions on a cycle, so every rotation brings about a change in the Item Shop. These changes may include some holdovers from the previous day (this is true especially for collaborations) mixed with brand new items.</p><p>When does that occur?</p><p>The official reset time is at 00:00 UTC, which is effectively midnight. UTC is the local time zone to Greenwich, England, so that translates to 7:00 pm EST, 5:30 pm IST and 4:00 pm PST.</p><p>At that time, the Item Shop resets. This means, if you happen to be online at the exact time it resets, that all the items currently in the shop will change. Some will remain but it will refresh and start the countdown over once again.</p><p>From then, players have 24 hours to access the skins there and purchase them or other cosmetics. Once that cycle ends, there’s no guarantee anything will remain present. Sometimes, they don’t even return in the near future. Certain items that Fortnite has made have not been seen by anyone in the Item Shop for four years or more.</p><p>As such, it is imperative to know a couple of things: Firstly, when the Item Shop resets, which is 7:00 pm EST. If you don’t know that time, you might miss an entire cycle and not have the ability to purchase a skin you want. Secondly, it is imperative to know what’s available. There are usually several sections in the shop, which means several options. It’s best to check the entire thing to ensure you don’t miss a rare cosmetic or something you really want.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaJ6fp8GvtdOeZKKslaJ6tLTOqWatp52kv7O71g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
