Carter kept her own family name and the couple moved to the Atlanta area, where they focused on raising their son, Hugo James Wentzel (b. 1999).</p><p>Carter illustrated The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer, her father's book for children, published in 1995.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, Carter has maintained a low profile, neither participating in public protests nor granting interviews. She is a member of the board of counselors of the Carter Center that advocates human rights and diplomacy as established by her father.</p><p>Carter attended Brown University but was academically dismissed in 1987, "for failing to keep up with her course work". She later earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (BFA) from the Memphis College of Art and received a master's degree in art history from Tulane University in New Orleans in 1996.</p><p>Carter did not receive the "hands off" treatment that most of the media later afforded to <a href=#>Chelsea Clinton</a>. President Carter mentioned his daughter during a 1980 debate with Ronald Reagan, when he said he had asked her what the most important issue in that election was and she said, "the control of nuclear arms". Once, when asked whether she had any message for the children of America, Amy replied with a simple "no". Controversy resulted when Carter was seen reading a book during a state dinner at the White House, which was seen as being offensive to foreign guests.</p><p>Carter later became known for her political activism. She participated in a number of sit-ins and protests during the 1980s and early 1990s that were aimed at changing U.S. foreign policy towards South African apartheid and Central America. Along with activist <a href=#>Abbie Hoffman</a> and 13 others, she was arrested during a 1986 demonstration at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for protesting CIA recruitment there. She was acquitted of all charges in a well-publicized trial in Northampton, Massachusetts. Attorney <a href=#>Leonard Weinglass</a>, who defended <a href=#>Abbie Hoffman</a> in the Chicago Seven trial in the 1960s, utilized the necessity defense, successfully arguing that because the CIA was involved in criminal activity in Central America and other hotspots, preventing it from recruiting on campus was equivalent to trespassing in a burning building.</p><p>In January 1977, at the age of nine, Carter entered the White House, where she lived for four years. She was the subject of much media attention during this period, as young children had not lived in the White House since the early 1960s presidency of John F. Kennedy (and would not again do so after the Carter presidency until the inauguration of Bill Clinton, in January 1993, when Chelsea moved in.)</p><p>Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was her nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.</p><p>Amy Lynn Carter (born October 19, 1967) is the daughter of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and <a href=#>Rosalynn Carter</a>. Carter entered the limelight as a child when she lived in the White House during the Carter presidency.</p><p><a href=#>Amy Carter</a> was born on October 19, 1967, in Plains, Georgia. In 1970 her father was elected Governor of Georgia, and then in 1976, President of the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrq6ecKaqa2dog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
