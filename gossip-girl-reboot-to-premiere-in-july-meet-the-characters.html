The cast of the new series posed together for the May issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, detailing their characters for the first time since the streaming service ordered 10 episodes of the new show in 2019.
“The dynamic with the cast, from the second we all met, has always been like, ‘Oh, we’ve known each other in different lives,’” Emily Alyn Lind, who plays Audrey, told the magazine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Plans for a “continuation” of the popular show were announced in 2019.</p><p>“There aren’t, like, new actors playing Serena and Blair,” executive producer (of both shows) <strong>Josh Schwartz</strong> said at the Television Critics Association summer press tour at the time. “They played those characters for six years, and if they felt like they were good with that, we wanted to respect that. But obviously, it would be great to see them again.”</p><p>The official description for the drama reads: “Eight years after the original website went dark, a new generation of New York private school teens are introduced to the social surveillance of Gossip Girl. The prestige series will address just how much social media—and the landscape of New York itself—has changed in the intervening years.”</p><p>While fans are finally getting answers about the new Upper East Side crew (keep scrolling for the character breakdown), showrunner <strong>Joshua Safran</strong> wants the details of Gossip Girl herself (voiced by <a href=#><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a>, who narrated the original series) to remain tightlipped until the summer premiere.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My hope is that we make it to airing and people don’t know,” Safran told Cosmo of the new twist. “I would love to see that conversation happen in the context of people having seen it as opposed to talking about something they haven’t seen.”</p><p>Gossip Girl will start streaming on HBO Max in July.
