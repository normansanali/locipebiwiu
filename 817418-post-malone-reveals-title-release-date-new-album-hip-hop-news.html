He got his start as a rapper in the late 2010s, but he's managed to crossover in virtually every facet of entertainment. He has a controller emblazoned with his logo. The "Rockstar" singer made a cameo in the action remake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Road House</a>. He's even unavoidable in commercials. And now he's back with a brand new album for the summer. Post Malone thrilled fans by announcing the title and release date of the album on Instagram.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper used a photo of a Nashville billboard to unveil the title of the album, which is F-1 Trillion. This is a play on the F-1 truck, and it follows the Post Malone convention of tweaking items or phrases to give them a new meaning. Beerbongs and Bentleys (2018) exemplifies this, as does Twelve Karat Toothache (2022). F-1 Trillion will drop on August 16th, which means fans can expect to hear a lead single sooner rather than later. The truck imagery, and the Nashville setting of the billboard, of course, suggests that Malone is going to continue to pursue a country music direction. This is a direction that he's been going towards for the past couple months.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-post-malone-is-embracing-country-music>Post Malone Is Embracing Country Music</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In November 2023, Malone told Twitch viewers he'd been recording music for a new country album. "Country album is coming," he announced. "I keep singing a song that we made while I was in Nashville, and it's so f*ckin' sick, but it's not out. We made such sick music down in Nashville. It was so much, so much fun." The rapper also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teased a country collab</a> with Blake Shelton back in May. If any fans were in doubt that Post Malone was leaning more country, one need only look at his 2024 guest appearances. He showed up on the latest albums <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">from Taylor Swift and Beyonce</a>, with the latter being titled <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Cowboy Carter</a>. He's making it very clear where he's going.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To Post Malone's credit, he's wanted to make country since the start of the decade. In 2021, he told iHeart Radio that his dream was to make a crossover country album. "I wanted to create something everybody can get down to," he wrote in a statement. "People who like country will like it... People who like folk will dig it. Even people who like pop will be into it." It may have taken the rapper longer than he expected to do it, but F-1 Trillion is now around the corner.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Danilo is a writer based out of San Diego.
