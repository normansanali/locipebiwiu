Fans are asking questions after he started looking a bit different. He has possibly gained some change in his appearance which he didn’t have before. A Plastic surgeon <span>Dr. Youn</span> suggests that Ben has got <span>lip fillers.</span> He made a <span>video</span> to discuss Ben’s pout. He said that his filler apparently migrated, causing his bottom lip to look enlarged and abnormal.</p><p>Some fans say Ben’s lips weirdly don’t seem to suit his face and it’s like he opted for a 1950s leading man lip, but the rest of his face is just average. Meanwhile, the media personality decided to shut down the rumors himself after Dr. Youn’s video went viral. He is aware that a lot of people are eager to assume that he got bad lip fillers. Ben continues to shut down the people’s speculations by saying that it isn’t lip fillers and is just not a very good picture of him.</p><p>The radio host admits that he never had fillers and has no intention of having fillers. He also added that he has never gotten <span>Botox injections</span> as well since some fans think he might have gone under the knife to cope with the effects of aging. At his age which is almost his forties, Shapiro should get wrinkles on his face. But he still has a <span>clean appearance</span> without any wrinkles on his face. Because men rarely use skin care products, they are more likely to show signs of aging than women. Also, men do not use heavy makeup as women do.</p><p>However, we must consider how Ben can maintain such a youthful appearance if he does not take steps to prevent aging signs from appearing on his skin. The answer should be based on the procedure he selects. However, the procedure he performs is not natural because natural procedures would have to be performed a long time ago and the results would not be as dramatic as he has now.</p><p>Whatever the truth is, we would like everyone to keep in mind that all of the information provided is purely speculative. We will certainly get back to you as soon as we learn more about Ben Shapiro’s possible plastic surgery procedure.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=know-more-about-ben-shapiro></span>Know More About Ben Shapiro!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Ben Shapiro&nbsp;</span>(b.
