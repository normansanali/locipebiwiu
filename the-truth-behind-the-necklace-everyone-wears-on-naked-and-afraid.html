The string-like necklace has a large bead that remains in the front and does have a purpose. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cinemaholic</a>, the necklace serves as a microphone since a typical wired microphone can't hook on to their clothes due to the contestants being naked. The microphone is also waterproof in case survivalists need to swim or go into a body of water.</p><p dir=ltr>The cast of "Naked and Afraid" doesn't speak about the necklaces on camera, and they do not draw any unnecessary attention toward them. And despite the use of one simple accessory, the contestants are facing all of their challenges fully naked, which is arguably more dangerous than being fully clothed. Also, there are some mental roadblocks that come with being naked in front of a complete stranger and full crew. Stacey Lee Osorio, a former participant, told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;that she has a "ton of self-esteem issues."</p><p dir=ltr>Alyssa Ballestero also got candid with the outlet about how she really felt being naked in front of the show's crew. "I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm a pretty shy person," Ballestero said. "I don't just take off my clothes for any reason. It was awkward, and the crew was like, "Oh, don't worry. We've seen it all before.' and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, but you haven't seen me before!'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW1nbX53e9OhnGasoqrBqXnBnp%2BippRiwamxjKecnKOclrCmecSvnKuxn6OybsPEmqmsZZ%2Bjeq%2Btyp6bZpmemXqistGaoJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
