The pair showed up together on Netflix’s reunion. Based on the special, Sal is serious about the relationship and even thought about proposing to his girlfriend. Sal and Jessica’s paths crossed at the birthday party of Sal’s sister Victoria.</p><p>In the second episode, Sal discussed his connection with Jessica. “The minute we met, there was something there, “the executive assistant of the Tourism Sales company said in a confessional. “She is such a firecracker. If she is in a room, you know that she is in a room. And she will just put a smile on everybody’s face. She is the nicest person that I’ve ever met, and honestly, I’ve never had more fun with anyone else.”</p><p>Jessica also reciprocated similar feelings toward sal. “I really love how open and honest Sal is,” Jessi conceded when asked what their favorite thing about one another is, making it clear that their romance truly is as genuine as it gets. “He’s my best friend. Like, I just f**king love him.”</p><p>As expected, viewers could sense tension between Jessica and Sal’s ex-fiance, and Love Is Blind cast Mallory Zapata. But, Mallory made it clear that they were good. After Jess meets with Sal’s fellow casts at the reunion, the dating pair returned to Chicago. Upon returning, Sal opened up to his sisters Victoria and Daisy that he is contemplating popping the big question to Jessica.</p><p>“With Jessi, it’s just been effortless,” Sal opened up with his sisters. “She’s great… I’ve been thinking a lot about what it would mean to propose to Jessi. We’ve had a lot of great conversations, a lot of meaningful conversations that make me feel like, should I just do that?”</p><p>As expected, Victoria and Daisy advised him to take his time before rushing to make the big decision. He asserted that he wasn’t only thinking about but had already bought an engagement ring to propose to Jessica’s hand. It is unclear currently whether he did it or not.</p><p>The three-part reunion on Sal’s part was too much to handle for fans. According to Sal, he began receiving negative comments so he had to defend his relationship and plan for the proposal. He took to his Instagram and shared that he had expected the bashing that he had received.</p><p>Sal added that he stands by his actions and “are staying grounded in the power of the truth.”</p><p>Defending his girlfriend, Sal also added, “Lastly, we were asked not to post about our relationship for almost a year — I won’t tolerate anyone discrediting Jessi’s work, or devaluing her worth just because of this show…” He concluded, “I know how lucky I am to get to experience a love like this, so I’m going to protect and cherish every moment of it. In a battle against hate, love will always withstand the test of time. So, we hope you’ll stick around for the love.”</p><p>So, are they still together? Most likely they are still together even if Sal hasn’t proposed to her yet. But, Jessica whose latest post on Facebook is in May 2022, shared that her relationship status is “single”.</p><p><strong>Did You Know:</strong> Jessica Palkovic was previously married to her ex-husband <span class=rse6dlih>Bobby Wilhelmson.
