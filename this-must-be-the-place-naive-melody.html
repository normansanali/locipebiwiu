Depression. When depressed you just wanna be home. Depression makes you feel numb. “The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong ."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When depressed you just wanna be home. Depression makes you feel numb.</p><p>“The less we say about it the better<br>Make it up as we go along<br>Feet on the ground<br>Head in the sky<br>It's ok I know nothing's wrong . . nothing”</p><p>I can hear that second nothing accompanied by tears! Like he is trying to persuade himself nothings wrong. Depressed people are told they can control their thinking and be positive. Telling one’s self what feeling they wanna feel, to make it come to reality by thinking it, reaffirming no it etc.<br>We’ll head in the clouds and feet on the ground sounds great to people who are down. Also, sounds like getting high on cannibus which is helpful for these symptoms of depression.<br>And well stigmas make depressed people wanna say as little as possible about it as to not bother others with their issues. And or the judgement that comes along with it.</p><p>“Hi yo I got plenty of time<br>Hi yo you got light in your eyes<br>And you're standing here beside me<br>I love the passing of time<br>Never for money<br>Always for love<br>Cover up and say goodnight . . . say goodnight”</p><p>When a friend or kind person is helping them you see the light in their eyes. I think the cover up and say good night is related to how depressed people sleep as to not feel the pain inside. Never of money always for love is well gotta pay psychiatrists but a friend or partner it’s all live helping your depressed friend!</p><p>“Home - is where I want to be<br>But I guess I'm already there<br>I come home - she lifted up her wings<br>Guess that this must be the place<br>I can't tell one from another<br>Did I find you, or you find me?<br>There was a time Before we were born<br>If someone asks, this is where I'll be . . . where I'll be”</p><p>Being accepted with all your problems and issues by a special person like an Angel! Wings-Angel. Comfort.</p><p>Hi yo We drift in and out<br>Hi yo sing into my mouth<br>Out of all those kinds of people<br>You got a face with a view<br>I'm just an animal looking for a home<br>Share the same space for a minute or two<br>And you love me till my heart stops<br>Love me till I'm dead<br>Eyes that light up, eyes look through you<br>Cover up the blank spots<br>Hit me on the head Ah ooh</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZq2ZnKC2r7OMoZyanKNkwam10makrqukYq%2BmedOhnGaonJawpnnNmqCvnV2isq27w7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
