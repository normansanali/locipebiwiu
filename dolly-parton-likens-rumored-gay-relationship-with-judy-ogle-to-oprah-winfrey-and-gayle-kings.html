I’m not gay, but I have so many gay friends, and I accept everybody for who they are.</p><p>Dolly, who has been friends with Judy since they were teenagers, contrasts Oprah Winfrey and her best pal, Gayle King, to the allegations about their relationship. She says, “Well, people love to talk, people love to gossip. They’ve said that about Oprah but it’s not true.”<br>Dolly appears to be exempt from such misleading claims about her, having been in the film business since the 1960s. “People love to talk – but sometimes that’s your best publicity. I don’t care what they say as long as they don’t hurt other people I love,” she says.</p><p>“Judy and I have been best friends for 64 years, since we were little kids.

But Dolly identifies herself as “an old timer.” In reality, with today’s pop stars who identify themselves as gender fluid, pansexual or transgender, like her own god-daughter, Miley Cyrus, she does not seem to grasp.</p><p>“I think they just want to be part of that whole movement to make people think that they’re so free and all that. But I don’t really know how they feel inside. I know how I feel inside.” She says, “Miley, she does a lot of stuff for effect, and I think a lot of them do.”<br>Often I think that talking out like that is now being sort of trendy.
