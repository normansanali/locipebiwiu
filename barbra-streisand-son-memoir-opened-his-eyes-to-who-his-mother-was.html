"I can't remember what she said [in detail], but I didn't know that about her." <strong>In the same interview, Gould also discussed how he was impressed with the memoir and read it all. </strong>"I thought it was very honest, and I thought it was well-written. It had painful [parts] that were a little hard to read," he said. "We all have trauma. That's the thing. Including me.

This includes the things she had to overcome and the trauma she lived with, which would, in turn, impact his own life.</strong></p><p>"My mother lost her father when she was an infant, so that's a huge trauma," he said. "She had a stepfather who was abusive. That's a huge trauma. My father's mother had tremendous trauma. How could that not affect him and, therefore, affect me? How could my mother's trauma not, therefore, affect me? It has, even in ways that I'm sure they're not even conscious of."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But who is Gould? He was born in December 1966 and is the son of actor Elliott Gould. His parents were married for eight years but divorced in 1971. <strong>Growing up with parents who were successful in the entertainment industry, it is perhaps unsurprising that he chose to follow in their footsteps with a career as an actor and musician</strong>. However, having the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confidence to perform was initially a challenge</a>.</p><p>"I honestly didn't know if I could do it. I had never performed in front of anybody so going from zero to like 18,000 people was quite a challenge," he told People in an interview in 2017.</p><h2 id=what-has-barbra-streisand-said-about-motherhood>What Has Barbra Streisand Said About Motherhood?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/barbra-streisand.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Barbra Streisand had a difficult relationship with her mother and has previously discussed her coldness</strong>. "I think sometimes there are parents who don't really like themselves. They don't like their offspring either. My mother meant well. She loved me as best she could," she said, per Daily Mail. "She had dreams of her own, and she wanted to be a singer."</p><p>Streisand also commented on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mother's attitude to her success</a>. "She never praised me to my face, but I have a feeling she praised me to other people. And she wasn't a toucher," she said. "She never hugged me or said words like, 'I love you.'" <strong>Streisand's approach to her child, Jason Gould, is quite different</strong>, and on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother's Day in 2022</a>, she posted a sweet photo on Facebook of them holding hands. "Nothing better than being a mother! Happy Mother's Day ladies," she captioned the post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/barbra-streisand-slammed-vicious-reports-against-her-in-an-old-interview-with-rosie-o-donnell-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Barbra Streisand Slammed Vicious Reports Against Her In An Old Interview With Rosie O'Donnell</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Barbra Streisand spoke out about extremely damaging reports about her during a daytime talk show appearance.</span><p>In 2020, Streisand posted two photos of herself kissing Gould on his cheek (one as a young child and another of him as an adult).
