Following on from their debuts in the third act of 2019’s Shazam!, Adam Brody, Meaghan Good, Ross Butler and D.J. Cotrona are all back as the aged-up versions of Freddy Freeman, Darla Dudley, Eugene Choi and Pedro Pena, respectively. Michelle Borth is no longer joining them as Mary Marvel AKA Mary Bromfield, however.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Instead, Grace Fulton is playing both the regular Mary and the superhero Mary this time around. After fans started enquiring about Borth’s absence from the group pic, Sandberg confirmed on Twitter that the actress is not involved in Fury of the Gods. The filmmaker jokingly offered an explanation for how Mary will still maintain her secret identity.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes, Grace now plays both parts. But her hair and makeup is slightly different when she’s super so nobody will ever recognize her. Hey, it works for Wonder Woman! <a href=#>https://t.co/suaG3vaEZw</a></p><p>— David F.

By the time of Shazam! 2, Mary will be the only actual adult among the heroes. It’s possible the Shazam powers will affect her differently now, then, and she’ll remain in her regular form, just with enhanced abilities, instead of physically transforming like the others. <a href=# rel=noopener>Borth was known</a> to have signed a multi-picture deal originally, so it’s unlikely it was her to decision to leave.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Mark Strong is also not returning as Dr. Sivana in the follow-up, despite the last film’s post-credits scene. Instead Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are serving as the new villains, a couple of Greek goddesses. Rachel Zegler is also joining the cast as a new ally for the family. <strong>Shazam! Fury of the Gods</strong>&nbsp;is on course to blast into theaters in June 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqGZqpa6brLUq7Bmn5%2BZwG68x6irqGWimsOmrcusZKaZmqS%2Fbr%2FHmrGapV2brq61y7JkrKCRoLK2vI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
