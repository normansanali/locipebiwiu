WWE wants to push Roman Reigns’ storyline at Royal Rumble, but it must be careful not to overshadow other performers:
• AJ Styles is finally coming to WWE after building a name for himself as one of the best pure wrestlers alive.
• Daniel Bryan, everyone’s favorite underdog, is returning to WWE after being sidelined since May with his second major injury in two years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here’s an excerpt:</p><p class="Tab-brief-dropcap TAB">WWE wants to push Roman Reigns’ storyline at Royal Rumble, but it must be careful not to overshadow other performers:</p><p class="Tab-brief-bullets TAB">• AJ Styles is finally coming to WWE after building a name for himself as one of the best pure wrestlers alive.</p><p class="Tab-brief-bullets TAB">• Daniel Bryan, everyone’s favorite underdog, is returning to WWE after being sidelined since May with his second major injury in two years.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">Styles performing in WWE is exciting, but don’t expect him to become world champion anytime soon — or at all. Styles will get a good payday, and he’ll be a top attraction when WWE Network launches in Japan, given he just departed New Japan Pro Wrestling.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">Bryan’s return to the ring once WWE feels he’s medically ready is exciting. I’ve referred to Bryan as the best bell-to-bell performer. It’s thrilling, but also scary. I also don’t expect him to become world champion again given his medical history. Unfortunate, but it’s reality.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">Styles and Bryan could appear in Sunday’s Royal Rumble, during which unadvertised surprises are typical. If they show up, WWE must learn from the past in deciding where and how to use them.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">In Pittsburgh two years ago, Bryan wasn’t used at the Rumble and fans let WWE hear it. I agreed with this protest, which resulted in Bryan being added to the WrestleMania main event. Bryan was a rising star, he stayed healthy, and he appealed to both casual and hardcore viewers.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">Last year in Philadelphia, Bryan made his return to the ring after being injured nine months earlier — and injury that forced him to vacate the WWE world heavyweight championship. He returned to the Rumble in the 10th position, and he was eliminated 10 minutes later. It wasn’t the return fans had hoped for. The crowd rejected Roman Reigns’ victory.</p><p class="Tab-brief-text TAB">WWE’s mistake was bringing Bryan back in a match in which he delivered a less-than-thrilling performance. Bryan should have never been mentioned until after the event. If fans didn’t know he was healthy or even an option to be in the Rumble, perhaps the revolt could have been avoided. But because Bryan was in the Rumble, the possibility of a stellar showing was dangled on a string to his biggest fans.</p><p><a href=#>CLICK HERE</a>&nbsp;for what will happen this year, who will be a surprise entrance and what role Bryan/Styles should have at WrestleMania.</p><p>Photo courtesy of Getty images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpVua3JxXay1unnDmqWinZxir7PFwKdkmqJdqMG6uMSsZKygn6q5pbrTZpmeZZmjerW0xGapqLGRoXqzwcybo54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
