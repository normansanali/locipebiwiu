On July 9, 2008, he made a deal of 2 years, a $2.4 million contract with the Wizards. McGee had to give a fine of $10 K by the Wizards for taking part in Gilbert Arenas’ antics on January 9, 2010, before a match on January 5, 2010, in which the opposite team was the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 6, 2011, McGee again was able to take part in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. McGee was the 1st Wizard to ever take part there. Unfortunately, he lost to&nbsp;Blake Griffin.

His career-high twelve blocks were the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, he got some disapproval for taking ill-advised shots in the 4th quarter to make sure that he would score ten points while his group was being blown out, and also got a technical foul for the excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his last points. TV commentator Kevin McHale said it was a “bad triple-double”. In reply, McGee said, “I got a triple-double. Who can say they got a triple-double? I’m not worried about it”. At the time of the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around thirty players on October 14.</p><h4>Further…</h4><p>JaVale quit the meeting early and told reporters there were several players “saying that they’re ready to fold”, but most of them were together. Later he disagreed quoting that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters.

On July 18, 2012, McGee again signed with the Nuggets on a 4-year, $44 million contract. His 2013–14 season was completed on February 20, 2014, when he had surgery to fix a stress fracture in his left tibia which he underwent on November 8, 2013.

Later the same year, he showed his interest in playing for the Philippine national group. In 2012, a bill was made for his Filipino citizenship to make him eligible to play for Smart Gilas. Moreover, in the year 2014, McGee was asked again by the Gilas Pilipinas to participate as a naturalized player in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. But national groups were limited to 1 naturalized player apiece, and a Wizards member Andray Blatche made the World Cup group after he was permitted citizenship.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-94007 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JaVale-McGee-scoring-the-basketball.jpg alt="JaVale McGee" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-94007 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: JaVale McGee scoring the basketball (Source: Instagram)</p><h4><span>Net Worth 2024</span></h4><p>The basketball player has a good <strong>net worth</strong> of around $14 million.
