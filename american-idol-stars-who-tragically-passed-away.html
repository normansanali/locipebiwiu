News. With so many amazing things happening in her career, we never would've expected her life to be cut short in January 2018 when she and her boyfriend, former professional basketball player Rasual Butler (pictured, left), were killed in a car accident in Studio City, Calif.</p><p>After a lengthy, months-long investigation, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported Butler, who was behind the wheel, had "multiple substances in his system at the time of his fatal crash." Toxicology results showed he tested positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and oxycodone, and an "empty box of Don Julio tequila was recovered at the crash scene."</p><p>An outpouring of love was sent to their families upon their death, including a message from Barrino, who <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "This just doesn't seem right even saying right now but Rest In Peace Baby Girl @leahlabelle I will never forget you. Idol Family Forever."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxnbYN1e8CmnKuhk5a7brXDqKNmq6SWv7R51qGmZqyilrSqr8Clo7JloJbAtLHDZpiwmalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
