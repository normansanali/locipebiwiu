Recommended Videos The fertile mind of Charles Dickens created plenty of rich characters, and few are as captivating as The Artful Dodger. It was only a matter of time before a big studio plubmed the world of the nimble-fingered thief and came out with some sparkling content, and in 2023 Disney did just that. The eponymous show follows the life of the Dodger, now known as Jack Dawkins."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As it begins, we see he’s turned over a new leaf and become a surgeon in Australia, giving up his life of crime. However, when the twisted Fagin finds his way back in the Dawkins’ life, the doctor realizes that old habits die hard, and begins to think he might not belong in the new, refined world in which he’s ended up.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>The dark but comic series quickly gained a loyal fanbase, and critics were also impressed with the show. It currently sits <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on a very respectable 93% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which goes to show just how popular it has become. However, as many heartbroken Santa Clarita Diet fans know, a devoted group of watchers and critical acclaim doesn’t always lead to a renewal. And, if we’re honest, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney isn’t always great</a> at keeping content alive.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>So, is the show set in Victorian Australia going to be back for a second go? We’ve had a little snoop around to try and find out the answer to the question: will there be The Artful Dodger season 2?

So, even the biggest fan would have already been reckoning with the notion that they weren’t getting a second helping of The Artful Dodger.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Then again, when something that works as a one-time series gets big enough (read: makes enough money), studios are always willing to bring it back.
