She moves into an eerie house owned by two brothers, Red (Marc Menchaca) and Becker (David Figlioli), only to discover that they are hiding a monster with an insatiable thirst for blood in the basement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Despite the hour-and-25-minute-long showing time, the monster only comes out of its box to play toward the end of the movie. It has unusual arms and a disproportionately put-together body.</p><p>Its distressed skin and odd figure garnered some shocked responses. As Monica Castillo writes for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RogerEbert.com</a>, its tooth-filled mouth located on the lower half of its body can also be compared to a vagina dentata.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/Bu6yGSXZG/200x200/author-photo-1699542564044.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does the monster in 'No One Gets Out Alive' let anyone get out alive?</h2><p>As a scene in the second half of No One Gets Out Alive shows, the monster doesn't immediately jump on the opportunity to devour all of its victims. The monster forces its victims to see visions — strange, memory-slash-mental images.</p><p>In Ambar's case, she sees herself sitting by her mother's deathbed. The mental image serves as a recurring motif throughout the movie. Either way, she doesn't let it fool her — which might be one of the reasons why she doesn't fall victim to the monster.</p><p>Ambar turns out to be the only character of the movie who survives. She kills Red and Becker, the evil brothers responsible for feeding new victims to the hideous creature in the basement.</p><p>In a crucial scene of the movie, she discovers that the monster also has healing capacities — and that it can help cure injuries like a broken foot.
