In May 1946, Francis survived his first scheduled execution when the electric chair malfunctioned because a drunk prison guard had set it up incorrectly. Francis then appealed his death penalty, citing double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the appeal, and the second attempt to execute Francis was successful.</p><h2>1960: The First Birth Control Pill Is Approved</h2><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves the first commercially-produced birth control pill, Enovid-10. The search for a practical and effective form of birth control had been in progress for several decades, led in part by Margaret Sanger. In the 1950s, John Rock and Gregory Pincus began testing a pill that used synthetic forms of progesterone and estrogen to stop women from ovulating. The contraceptive proved successful, and the FDA’s approval of the pill was a milestone for women’s reproductive freedom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wxm6F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
