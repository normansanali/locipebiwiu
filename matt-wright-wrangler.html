Matt defines himself based on the work he does and doesn’t like being compared to anyone else. As the man puts it, “Jesus, I’m Matt Wright, I’m going to do my own shit.” It is easy to say the man has garnered immense fame in his line of work however he is getting more news coverage in media and outlets for an entirely different reason as of late in 2023. He has been charged in relation to a fatal helicopter crash that happened in February 2022.&nbsp;The crash killed his friend and co-star Chris Wilson, who was collecting crocodile eggs in a remote area of west Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.&nbsp;Wright was not on board the helicopter at the time of the crash. In this article, we will take a closer look at everything concerning his biography.</p><p><strong>Matt Wright is an Australian television personality, wildlife expert,&nbsp; and crocodile wrangler who is best known for his work on the National Geography show “Outback Wrangler” and Netflix’s “Wild Croc Territory” reality show.
