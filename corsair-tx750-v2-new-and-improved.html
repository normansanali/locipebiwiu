Looking at our measurements, we see that this is a very well-regulated PSU with moderate ripple and noise results and a strong (but noisy) fan. Comparing the ratings on the label with reality, we have to mention the wrong documentation for the +12V rail; this is in fact a multi-rail design. There are two different solder points and there is no direct connection between those rails."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Comparing the ratings on the label with reality, we have to mention the wrong documentation for the +12V rail; this is in fact a multi-rail design. There are two different solder points and there is no direct connection between those rails. Sometimes there is a big wire on the back of the PCB to create a single-rail where multi-rails was planned, but we can find nothing to suggest that is present. Thus, Corsair has two rails, just like the original S12D design that serves as the basis for this PSU.</p><p>The package includes all the important accessories for installation and a user guide. Like the previously tested <a href=#>Antec HCG 750W</a>, the Corsair TX V2 750W uses fixed cables. All the cables have lengths of 60cm or more, so this PSU will work well in larger cases. It includes four 6/8-pin PCIe connectors and 16 peripheral connectors (8 SATA + 8 Molex), plus an FDD adapter (15cm). The black cable sleeving is better than the cheaper version where you still can see every single cable. Moreover it looks very nice and fits with the black finish of the case.</p><p><img border=0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4311/1_corsair2.PNG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Internally, Corsair implemented a well-equipped filtering stage against emission from the conductors. Furthermore, the case has a good shielding. Corsair uses well chosen capacitors from Nippon Chemi-Con and Rubycon. There is a lot of glue inside, but glue is a good and cheap solution for stabilizing components. The PSU has active PFC, all the important safety functions, and not least DC-to-DC VRM with all solid capacitors. All other parts have components from reliable sources.</p><p>The TX750 doesn't need active rectifying with modern transistors to reach 80 Plus Bronze. Even so, the efficiency is relatively high with 76-86% at 115VAC and even better 81-88% with 230VAC. (If you only run at 20% loads or higher, minimum efficiency climbs to 83%/84% for 115VAC/230VAC.) Considering the good efficiency, the fan could be quieter, particularly at low loads. 24 dBA is too high for 10% load when other manufacturers are able to stay under 20dBA with low temperatures.</p><p>The Corsair TX V2 750W may not be the greatest in all areas, but it does have some advantages over the competition. The voltage regulation is excellent, with all rails starting at less than 1% overvoltage and landing very close to 0% at overload. The <a href=#>current online price of $105</a> ($95 after $10 mail-in rebate) makes the Corsair TX V2 750W affordable and puts it near the top of the "budget" 750W list, even with all the opponents it has to face. <a href=#>Antec's HCG 750W</a> has great components and performance as well, but the price and ripple results are higher. The <a href=#>PC Power & Cooling Silencer 760W</a> is another strong competitor, but the price is higher ($110 after rebate; $130 otherwise). The design is almost the same as well, since the PCP&C is identical to the older Seasonic S12D while Corsair is using the improved version.</p><p>Overall, the Corsair looks to be the best of the less expensive 750W PSU offerings right now, and it's a definite improvement over the <a href=#>original TX750</a>. If you want to buy an 80 Plus Gold model with a good fan, the <a href=#>Corsair AX750</a> is still better, but you're looking at $160 for the slight improvement in results—definitely a case of diminishing returns. If 80 Plus Bronze certification is sufficient for your needs, and you don't mind the fixed cables, the TX750 V2 is a good buy. Let's hope Corsair can bring this quality into lower rated power supplies as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF0fZBomqiqo5a2s3nTsW5uaF2rf266xLBkmqaUYrauvNGorZ6cX2s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
