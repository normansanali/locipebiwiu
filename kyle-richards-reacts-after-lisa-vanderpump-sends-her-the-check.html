However, Richards and the executive declined to pay the tab. Vanderpump told the outlet that she left an imprint of her credit card and a cash tip for the waiter just in case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kyle-Richards-Reacts-After-Lisa-Vanderpump-Sends-Her-the-Check-During-Restaurant-Run-In.jpg><p>An <a href=#>Instagram</a> user later alleged that Vanderpump “left the restaurant and scribbled all over her former co-stars faces after a fan approached and asked her to sign his #RHOBH print.” The accompanying photo showed <a href=#><strong>Erika Jayne</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Teddi Mellencamp</strong></a> with x’s drawn over their faces, while Richards and <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> had mustaches added to their faces. Vanderpump’s image featured her autograph and a heart.</p><p>The Halloween star reacted to the alleged shade in the comments section. “Bitter Spice,” she replied.</p><p>Rinna, for her part, wrote, “Oof she’s so angry.” Mellencamp, 39, then remarked on the three x’s her picture received, since her leg was overlapping in front of Vanderpump. “I must be really special. I got 3 X X X,” she noted.</p><p>Vanderpump <a href=#>exited The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> in 2019 amid tension with her costars. She <a href=#>threw shade at her former castmates</a> during a Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen appearance in March.</p><p>“I’d look for the escape panel first. Then maybe ask if I could stand on her shoulders,” the Pooch Perfect judge replied when asked whether she would talk to Richards if they were stuck in an elevator together. “What is there to say? The only thing to be said is … it’s got to start with an apology. If someone calls you a liar, it’s not OK with me.”</p><p>Vanderpump revealed in March that her <a href=#>feud with her costars over “PuppyGate”</a> — when Richards claimed her former pal leaked a story to the press about a dog that Kemsley, 44, got from Vanderpump Dogs — led to her departing the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I left because I was very, very, <a href=#>very unhappy</a> and I didn’t appreciate being called a liar,” she explained on Us Weekly’s “Getting Real With the Housewives” podcast. “To accuse me of selling a story, when you never get stories come out of my restaurants, you know, so it was such an insult to me. It was about my heart, it was about the Vanderpump Dogs Foundation, which was something that was born out of complete compassion and my passion project. I just thought, ‘I’m done with it.’”</p><p>Us has reached out to Vanderpump’s rep for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyaerO1wqGYq5yjYr%2BmrcKtqmaZlqmys3nLoqqaZaaWu6Wx0amspqhdqLKvsNJmn56qXam1pnnCoZyco18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
