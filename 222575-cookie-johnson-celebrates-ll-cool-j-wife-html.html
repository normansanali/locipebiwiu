Simone and her husband have dedicated their lives to making their relationship a successful one.</p><p class=dh>LL Cool J, who is also an actor, often expresses that they have a good marriage. However, it has had its fair share of ups and downs. A few years ago, Simone was diagnosed with bone cancer. Her husband offered to have one of his bones removed for her.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Through this medium, they aim to advocate for cancer victims and help them through the process as much as they can.</strong></h3><p class=dh>He equally showed his support by being by her side all throughout. Fortunately, she did fight the disease and has been cancer-free for more than a decade.</p><p class=dh>Despite being a rapper and an actor, the father of four has never been involved in any type of scandal. Reportedly, Simone detailed that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/ncis-los-angeles-ll-cool-j-wife.html/>she stopped talking to him for two weeks</a> over a music video where a girl licked his face, but according to her husband, that was art. While he excused his behavior, the rapper also decided to respect his wife's wishes.</p><p class=dh>Apart from bringing their A-game to making their marriage work, <a class="me a" href=#>LL Cool J</a> and Simone have also been excellent parents to their kids, Najee, Italia, Nina, and Samaria.
