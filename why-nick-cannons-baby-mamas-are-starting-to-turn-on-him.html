Following their divorce, <a href=#>Nick welcomed a son with Brittany Bell in 2017</a>, followed by a son and daughter in 2020 and 2021. He also welcomed twins with Abby De La Rosa in 2021, and she gave birth to their third child earlier this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nick Cannon Openly Body-Shamed 50 Cent On Radio, And Doesn't Seem To Have Any Regrets</a></span></p><p>Nick also welcomed children with Brie Tiesi and LaNisha Cole in 2022. He had a baby with Alyssa Scott in 2021, only for their son to die at 5 months from brain cancer. Alyssa gave birth to their second child later earlier this year, making Nick a father for the 12th time.</p><p>Nick has insisted all of his children were planned, and for the most part, he seems to maintain amicable relationships with all of the mothers of his kids. But he recently had public drama with one of his baby mamas, Bre Tiesi, which suggests not everything is as copasetic as it seems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bre-tiesi-says-nick-cannon-has-too-many-kids-to-pay-child-support>Bre Tiesi Says Nick Cannon Has Too Many Kids To Pay Child Support</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bre-tiesi.jpg><p>Nick Cannon may have 12 children by 6 different women, but there’s been relatively little drama between the co-parents, despite how many people are involved (and how easily his baby mamas could become jealous). However, there appears to be growing tension between Nick and one of the mothers of his children, Bre Tiesi. The pair welcomed a son, Legendary Love, in June 2022.</p><p>During a recent episode of Selling Sunset, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre claimed Nick doesn’t pay child support</a> for any of his kids. But what caught the attention of fans the most was when she said Nick has too many kids to qualify for child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The way it works is, like, after 10, the court can basically say he can’t afford to pay child support,” she said on camera. “Or because he is who he is, they could say, ‘We know you can afford X amount for each for each household.'”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brie Tiesi May Not Need Nick Cannon's Support; Here's How Much She's Worth</a></span></p><p>Bre’s comments were immediately perceived at shade towards Nick. The backlash prompted her lawyer, Neama Rahmani, to issue a statement correcting what Brie said.</p><p>“Brie, you should know better!” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the attorney told Us Weekly</a>. “That is absolutely not true. There’s no cap on child support based on the number of children. So, to the extent that Nick Cannon can have babies, he owes child support for those babies under California law.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, this wasn’t the first time Nick has been called out by a baby mama. In December, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LaNisha Cole expressed frustration</a> over her baby’s father not having enough time to spend with all his kids. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick has previously expressed guilt</a> over feeling overwhelmed when dividing his time between his children’s households.</p><h2 id=nick-admits-he-doesn-rsquo-t-pay-child-support-but-says-he-makes-100-million-a-year>Nick Admits He Doesn’t Pay Child Support, But Says He Makes $100 Million A Year</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-7.jpg><p>While Brie’s claims about Nick having too many kids to qualify for child support may be untrue, the television host himself has admitted to not paying child support.</p><p>Last November, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report by The U.S. Sun</a> claimed that Nick pays $3 million in annual child support. However, he was quick to dispute the claims, insisting he pays much more, even though there’s no legal arrangement in place. “I definitely spend a lot more than that on my children annually,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick said while speaking to The Neighborhood Talk</a>. “I don’t plan to ever have to participate in the governmental system of child,” he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, the television personality has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed to be making $100 million annually</a>.</p><h2 id=nick-buys-cars-and-houses-for-the-mothers-of-his-12-children>Nick Buys Cars And Houses For The Mothers Of His 12 Children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fws_7uyauaegb81.jpeg><p>Nick may not be paying child support, but he’s proven that he takes care of his children and their mothers financially. For example, in September 202, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought a house for Abby De La Rosa</a> when she was pregnant with their third child.</p><p>“Here’s to beautiful new beginnings. I’m so grateful - Thank you Dad - Zion & Zillion,” Abby captioned a video of their toddler twins exploring the new mansion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Bre Tiesi's Marriage (Before She Met Nick Cannon)?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You are more than welcome!! It’s the least I can do, Thank you for the unconditional love and the most precious gifts any human can ask for!! BEAUTIFUL New Beginnings!” Nick replied back on the post.</p><p>More recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick made headlines for gifting Bre a Lamborghini</a> earlier this month for her birthday. "Nope! The Government don't have to tell us to pay Child Support… WE PAY LAMBO SUPPORT !!" he wrote in a post showing off the luxe gift. "My Money is Their Money! Just accept it, We different over here !! LOL."</p><p>To this, Bre wrote, “Tell ‘e, Daddy,” with a heart emoji, proving things must be better between the co-parents as of recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdo7akt4ycmKemn6PAbq7Am7BmpZGirrR5wKucZquklr%2B1tc2gZK2nXanCs7qMqKVmoJmifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
