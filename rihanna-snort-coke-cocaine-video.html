But there is the video right up top there, and if you watch all 15 seconds of it, you'll see for yourself that no, Rihanna cannot be seen inhaling drugs.
Unfortunately, the situation isn't that cut and dry.

Seated at a table but intermittently obscured by three smiling girls who dance in front of the camera, the "<a href=#>American Oxygen</a>" singer can be seen with what could be a straw. (It could also be a big ass joint!) The camera cuts away for a brief second, but when it returns, Rihanna is holding her nose and appears to be choking something back. Now, we're just bloggers over here at PopCrush, not forensic drug investigators, so we'll leave it to you to decide whether this confirms that Rihanna did indeed snort coke.</p><p>Rihanna has not officially commented on the allegations, though <a href=#>Perez Hilton</a> claims that Rihanna decided to air her side of the story in the comments section of Instagram. The comment, allegedly captured in screenshot, reads [sic]: "N--- your lame ass got some f---ing nerve!!! Any fool could see that's a joint that I'm basing with cigarette! Who tF snorts tobacco??!! FOH witcho 'never been to a rodeo so someone squeezing their nose means they're doing coke' lookin ass!!"</p><p>The singer, who is gearing up to release her eighth studio album, has been otherwise keeping her nose clean, if not always SFW. After lending her vocal talents to the box-office-smashing animated Dreamworks film <a href=#>Home</a>, Rihanna released banging new single "<a href=#>Bitch Better Have My Money</a>" — which she was later accused of <a href=#>stealing</a>. She debuted another new track, "American Oxygen," at the March Madness Music Festival, where she also went on an <a href=#>F-bomb-laced rant</a> attacking Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Law. She's also attached to <a href=#>Jay Z's artist-owned music streaming platform TIDAL</a>, which has been met with its own share of criticism.</p><p><strong>See Rihanna + More Celebs With Surprising Tattoos</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kv6q0wKelmmWjo7yzwIycpqSdXZi8pK3Ip5xmrpmZsrB7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
