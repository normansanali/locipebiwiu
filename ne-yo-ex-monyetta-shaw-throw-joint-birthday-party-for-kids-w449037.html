No beef, no bad blood, no shade … we are grown. This is what it looks like when grown-ups act like adults.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>During the party, guests snacked on a pizza buffet, salad and breadsticks. The birthday boy and girl each got their own cake; Mason’s cookies and cream-flavored cake was Paw Patrol–themed, while Madilyn’s strawberry cake was My Little Pony–themed. Guests also enjoyed personalized cookies decorated with cute pictures of Madilyn and Mason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ne-yo-madilyn-mason-955465c6-8cde-4449-99c7-b00cdf79ee85.jpg><p>“Ever since the M’s 2nd and 3rd birthday, Ne-Yo and I decided on a joint party for them because of dad’s busy schedule and the fact that their birthdays are close,” Shaw tells <i>Us</i>. “They actually love it because they are pretty much inseparable and BFFs. So we’ve made it our little tradition. … It was important for us to throw their birthday party together, as we have before, to continue to set a positive example for our kids and to let them know that no matter what, they are loved and celebrated.”</p><p>The <i>Bigger Than Me</i> author continues, “I understand that some exes can’t get along or stand to be in the same place with each other, but we have made a conscious decision not to be those people. We understand that respect for one another is important, even if we don’t see eye to eye on a situation. We figure it out as adults and ultimately come to a resolve. It is so important to coparent positively because that will determine the mind-set of our kids in the long run. They are the bigger picture. We do it for them.”</p><p>Ne-Yo and Shaw split and ended their engagement in June 2013. He is now married to model and actress <b>Crystal Renay</b>, with whom he shares 7-month-old son Shaffer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The well-being of the kids is our main focus, and our goal is to make sure that we lead by example,” Shaw tells <i>Us</i>. “We strive daily to ensure that they know the importance of family, love and positivity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGannV2uvG6x12akqKapmsG1rYysn5qvXam1s7vWZqGooZ6peqO10a2fnZmpYr2ivtOyZJ%2BnomK4qrDSZq5tbGllgHh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
