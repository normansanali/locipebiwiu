It’s tough, man,” Eilish said. “Honestly, nobody can say anything about my body that I don’t have a stronger opinion about […] I also think that if I was younger, like if the internet talked about me the way they do now when I was like 11, I don’t think I would be able to exist, to be honest.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to say that while she's been open about being able to brush off the comments in the past, they really do get to her. That brave front that we all see? Eilish admitted that even she can't ignore everything forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I like myself more than I used to, and I’m more interested in how I feel than how they feel," she added. "But then also that might be a load of bullshit, because it still hurts my feelings like a sonofabitch.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Cindy Ord/MG23/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eilish also spoke about her going from glam to, well, un-glam in the blink of an eye. While we were all oohing and aahing over her Simone Rocha look at the Met Gala, she couldn't wait to take it off afterwards and get into a sneakers.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I went back to the hotel and was just like, get this offfff me!” she said. “I put on big North Face pants, a big zip-up jacket, a backward hat, and some Jordans — and that’s how I feel the best. I feel so powerful like that.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But because Eilish is all about dichotomies, she also noted that she's not against getting glam every once in a while and is even getting more and more comfortable embracing her super-feminine side, even if parts of that still scare her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m trying to be more comfortable wearing makeup, like a lot of makeup,” she said. “Obviously, I wear a little makeup all the time, but it’s just like, big faces of makeup … it’s something that I look up to, and I admire, and for me, I’m just like so scared of it.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waKjpaGVYrKquMisn2aan5nGbrXMmp6eZZGYsKa805qlnJ1dmL%2BqwMicoKylXau8qMHEZqCnrJWnw6qx1mZubm1gaYNx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
