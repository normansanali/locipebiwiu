As long as she is happy and he treats her right, I am happy for her,” Frankie, 21, told <a href=#>Page Six</a> in an article published on Tuesday, March 24. “At the end of the day, she’s my friend, and if something was to happen in the future with us — time will tell.”</p><p>Gia, 19, is dating <strong>Christian Carmichael</strong>, as evidenced by a TikTok video in which she tagged him. “Frankie is an absolute doll. Christian is an absolute doll,” a Giudice family source tells Us Weekly. “The family is just happy that Gia is happy.”</p><p>Frankie and Gia sparked romance rumors in May 2019 when they <a href=#>attended prom together</a>. “Hi, Frankie,” Teresa, 47, said in an Instagram Story video at the time. “That’s my daughter’s prom date. Look how handsome he is.”</p><p>Gia’s makeup artist, Priscilla DiStasio, also raved about the pair on Instagram. “And off they go!” she captioned her post. “@_giagiudice you are a true beauty inside & out! Love you to the moon & back sis! You too @frank.catania You are one of a kind Gia & Frankie Prom 2019! I hope you guys have the best night ever !! Woohooo!”</p><p>Teresa, meanwhile, gave the duo her stamp of approval in December 2019. “I would love for that to happen, yes,” she told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;exclusively of the friends becoming something more. “I would love that!”</p><p>The&nbsp;Standing Strong&nbsp;author shot down the idea of her <a href=#>dating Frankie’s father, <strong>Frank Catania</strong></a>, though. “That would never happen, never!” she admitted to&nbsp;Us.</p><p>Teresa and Dolores, 49, have been friends since they were teenagers. However, that did not stop <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> from bringing up the <a href=#>couple potential</a> between the OG Housewife and Frank during a December 2019 episode of&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Oh! I mean, I don’t see that,” Dolores noted at the time. “No, Frank kids around about that.”</p><p>Cohen, 51, replied: “She loves a juicy dude and he’s juicy Frank!”</p><p>Dolores then confessed that “Frank is definitely her type and she is his type,” but in her opinion, “you don’t do that with friends.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafqpGjuKqxjJyYrZmenq5utdJmpaisXaKupXnGophmn5mqsaqvxGafmqtdlnqju9ifqaKdnpl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
