Her passing came as a complete and total surprise to us. This unexpected death has left a hole in our hearts, and when we think back on the wonderful moments we shared over the years and the tremendous bond we formed, we are filled with a sense of sorrow.</p><p>The origins of our friendship can be traced all the way back to Texas, where Kay and I both have our roots. As time went on, we went from being acquaintances to becoming fast friends, sharing life’s ups and downs, laughing, and adventures with one another. The fact that we were able to maintain our relationship is evidence of the enduring character of genuine friendship, which is not limited by either time or location.</p><p>I will always cherish the memories of our adventures together as vacation companions on Lake Hamilton. They are some of the most memorable times of my life. Through her ability to transform mundane occurrences into amazing experiences, Kay was able to weave a rich tapestry of happiness that characterised our time spent together. Every single one of those moments was genuinely remarkable, whether it was the sun setting over the lake or the sound of laughing reverberating through the air.</p><p>Kay came out to me not too long ago to discuss the process of downsizing her home, which is a demonstration of the pragmatic aspect of our long-lasting friendship. We were astounded by the passage of time and pondered aloud, “How did we manage to arrive at this location so quickly?” It served as a powerful reminder of the value of life and the significance of maintaining relationships with the people we hold dear over the passage of time.</p><p>David, Kay’s husband, and she got the opportunity to travel to Jacksonville not too long ago, and the happiness that they felt upon being reunited was evident. When we were given the opportunity to spend time together, we were filled with joy because we were able to share stories and take delight in the straightforward joys that come with friendship. Kay was one of those exceptional people with whom you never had to start a friendship over again; it was as if it had picked up just where it had left off, without any difficulty.</p><p>Kay will be greatly missed by all of us, in addition to the huge vacuum that her unexpected departure has left in our lives. She was more than just a friend; she was a wellspring of motivation, amusement, and unflinching support as well. The genuineness and sincerity with which she approached life left a lasting impression on all of us, and we will never forget her.</p><p>In the midst of our struggle to come to terms with the shock and loss of losing such a dear friend, let us take this opportunity to honour the lovely soul that was Kay Gilbert. A woman who had a tremendous influence on those who had the good fortune to know her should be remembered for the laughter, adventures, and profound conversations that we engaged in together. May these memories serve as a lasting monument to her.</p><p>For the days that lie ahead, let us remember the lessons that Kay imparted to us regarding the significance of friendship, the happiness that can be discovered in the simplest of moments, and the ephemeral nature of time. Despite the fact that she is not physically present with us anymore, her spirit and the warmth of her companionship will continue to live on in our collective hearts forever. May you find eternal rest, darling Kay, with the knowledge that you will forever be remembered with affection and affection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwt8CyZKChnJeys8CMqJmirKWWv7p5ypqwZp%2BZoa%2BmvtNmn5qrXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GueqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
