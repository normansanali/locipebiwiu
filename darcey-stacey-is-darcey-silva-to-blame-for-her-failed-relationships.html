The 46-year-old has yet to find a man that fits what she is looking for in a partner, however, has Darcey been looking in all the wrong places?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During tonight's episode of <a href=#><strong>Darcey & Stacey</strong></a>, the Silva sisters cut their Virginia/D.C trip short after Darcey's fallout with Georgi Rusev. Considering Stacey, Florian, and of course, the viewers all think <a href=#>Georgi is taking advantage of Darcey</a>, it was only a matter before she figured it out for herself!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Darcey & Stacey': Who Was Georgi Rusev Before Meeting Darcey?</a></span></p><p>After finally putting her foot down and leaving, fans don't think Darcey's revelation will last too long since <a href=#>she and Georgi are still together</a>. With so much having happened in her past relationships, fans think Darcey hasn't allowed herself to truly heal, which in turn, has sabotaged her romance with Georgi.</p><h2 id=does-darcey-silva-sabotage-her-relationships>Does Darcey Silva Sabotage Her Relationships?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things are heating up on Darcey & Stacey, and not in the best way, although when is it really ever in the best way with these two? As much fun as the Silva twins can be, their relationships are keeping us exhausted, especially when it comes to Darcey's debacle of a romance with Georgi Rusev.</p><p>Fans were in for yet another explosive episode as Darcey officially leaves Georgi behind in D.C, with her engagement ring, no less! Silva seemingly called off their engagement after her meeting with Georgi's ex, Octavia, sparking a huge blowup between the two.</p><p>Although Georgi's secretive ways and dodgy past are red flags, it's become clear that Darcey is no angel, either! When it comes to Darcey's past relationships, it seems as if there is a recurring pattern. Darcey and 90 Day Fiancé ex, Jesse Meester broke up following their massive fight where the two claimed they were "inauthentic", "dishonest", and "potentially unfaithful". Darcey also accused Jesse of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">using her for publicity</a>, something she also feels Georgi has done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, is Darcey innocent in all of this? No way! It's clear she needs to re-evaluate her expectations when it comes to potential partners. Many viewers have called out Darcey Silva for enabling toxic behavior within her relationships, hence why nothing ever changes, whether it be Jesse, Tom, and now Georgi.</p><p>One fan tweeted out saying, "Darcey should be on The Bachelorette! That way she will have 25 chances to ruin her relationships." Ouch! Although tough love isn't for everyone, viewers are tired of Darcey making the same mistakes when it comes to men, and it doesn't seem as if she'll be changing her ways anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Darcey & Stacey': Why Aren't Stacey's Kids On The Show?</a></span></p><h2 id=will-darcey-amp-georgi-get-back-together>Will Darcey & Georgi Get Back Together?</h2><p>While it's become clear that Darcey certainly played a role in sabotaging her and Georgi's relationship, perhaps it was for the best! After leaving Georgi behind, fans were finally glad to witness Darcey stand up for herself and know her worth.</p><p>During the end of the episode, Darcey and Stacey's friend, Reina made it clear that Darcey needs to take time and heal from her past romances, however, despite their friend's advice, Darcey and Georgi got back together! Despite their fights, disagreements, and many crying sessions, fans aren't too happy to hear that Darcey and Georgi ended up reconciling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Nightly Pop, hosts Morgan Stewart and Nina Parker inquired as to whether or not viewers would get to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darcey and Georgi walk down the aisle</a>, and while Darcey said we'll have to wait and see, we aren't too sure if we want to witness their nuptials. If their ongoing issues are any indication as to how married life will be between Darcey and Georgi, things aren't looking good.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Are Darcey And Stacey Silva Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqqTmsZuv9Oamp6xXZ7AbrDAq5qesV2otq3CwGarqGWSoa6usYyfpqtlmJq%2FbrLAoqOenF2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr20eY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
