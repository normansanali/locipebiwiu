He was so relatable, and he quickly won the hearts of the show's viewers. He was on the show for almost twenty years until 1975, alongside other short-lived game shows throughout that time.</p><p class=Fg>In 1972, he was given hosting duties for "The Price Is Right," a revival of its 1956 to 1965 run.
