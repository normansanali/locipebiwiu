He hosted "The Price Is Right" for an amazing 35 years, from 1972 to 2007.</p><p class=Fg>Initially, Barker had trained to become a US Navy fighter pilot in World War II.

He was so relatable, and he quickly won the hearts of the show's viewers. He was on the show for almost twenty years until 1975, alongside other short-lived game shows throughout that time.</p><p class=Fg>In 1972, he was given hosting duties for "The Price Is Right," a revival of its 1956 to 1965 run.

He hosted the show until his retirement in 2007 when he was replaced by Drew Carey.</p><p class=Fg>Other than his game shows, Barker was also often asked to host the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants for a couple of years. He's also appeared in several TV series, and in 1996, made his movie debut in "Happy Gilmore" alongside Adam Sandler.</p><p class=Fg>Through it all, Barker has won 14 Emmy Awards for his work.
