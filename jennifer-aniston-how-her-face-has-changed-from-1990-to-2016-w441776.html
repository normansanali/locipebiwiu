Her mother’s advice. “I’m really good with my skin. I think it’s the luck of having a mom [actress <b>Nancy Dow</b>] who was a model and was always obsessed with her skin,” the Living Proof cofounder <a href=#>told Yahoo Beauty</a>. “She always taught me to moisturize and wash my face every night, drink lots of water. It’s probably been the same routine since I was a kid. I use a Neutrogena face-cleaning bar, then I use the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer. Every once in a while, I bring in some toners or serums from my facialist.”</p><p><span><i>Friends</i> wrapped in 2004 after 10 seasons and Aniston, who divorced Pitt in 2005 and </span><a href=#><span>married </span><b>Justin Theroux</b><span> in the summer of 2015</span></a><span>, went on to star in plenty of rom-coms. </span><i>The Break-Up</i><span>&nbsp;in 2006, </span><i>He’s Just Not That Into You</i><span>&nbsp;in 2009 and </span><i>Just Go with It</i><span> in 2011 cemented her as a romantic lead in big-screen feature films.</span></p><p><i>Horrible Bosses</i> in 2011 and <i>We’re the Millers</i> in 2013 continued Aniston’s comedy spree, but she’s also taken on roles in serious tearjerkers like 2008’s<i> Marley & Me</i> and dramas including 2014’s <i>Cake</i>, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGjtrTAzqdkoaenYrWmvoyfmJydXZ2utHnCoZinn5WZeqe%2BzqZkanFpZXq1u4xrZ2puXayBdX2WcG1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
