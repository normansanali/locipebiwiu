During November sweeps, his impromptu wedding to Katie Logan (Heather Tom) was a big deal. For all of the trouble the writers went to for the ceremony and subsequent events, not seeing him around has been confusing.</p><h2>Ingo Rademacher addresses rumors</h2><p>After several days of speculation, Ingo Rademacher took to Instagram to confirm that he was no longer on contract with The Bold and the Beautiful. Speculation began when he was sharing photos of himself in Hawaii at his home.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ingo Rademacher (@ingorademacher)</a></p><p>There will be a few more episodes taped with Ingo Rademacher as Thorne in the new year, but after that, it is unclear where things will go. Will the show recast the role again? He made it clear they were parting amicably with a possible return in the future, but how will they explain Thorne’s absence?</p><h2>Could Ingo return to General Hospital?</h2><p>It looks like Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and Carly (Laura Wright) may be <a href=#>going through some things with Margaux</a> (Elizabeth Hendrickson). Rumors have swirled that he will once again cheat on his wife and she has made it clear that if that happens, she is done forever.</p><p>With Ingo Rademacher off contract, will ABC swoop in for a return of Jasper Jax? Carly loved him once and they share a daughter already. Could viewers see him back in Port Charles sometime in 2019?</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful airs weekdays on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWirn5a9tHvToZxmmp%2BhsW6tzZ1kraCVYq%2BmrdStoJ%2BtnGLAsbvIpZyrq12eu6i7jKuYnZ2dlrCpsdFmpq6sXZbAbsDHqKmnnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
