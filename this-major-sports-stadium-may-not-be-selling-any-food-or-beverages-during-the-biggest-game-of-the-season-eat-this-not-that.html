It’s all thanks to a strike that may take place across Dodger Stadium’s concession stands during the upcoming MLB All-Star Game.

The group is hoping to negotiate better conditions as part of a new contract with the stadium, which they are in the midst of finalizing.</p><p>The workers are requesting a contract similar to the one in the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Some of their requests include higher wages, for example, that dishwashers be paid $30 per hour, according to Restaurant Business.</p><p>“I voted ‘yes’ to strike because I often have to pick up shifts at the Rose Bowl just to try to make ends meet,” says Laura Ortiz, a Dodger Stadium bartender in a statement. “I love working at Dodger Stadium and know that our company can do better.”</p><p>So far, about 99% of the food and beverage workers—including the cooks, servers, bartenders, dishwashers, and suite attendees—have agreed to the strike, according to Maria Hernandez, a United Here spokeswoman. This means no 10-inch Dodger Dog, Korean Short rib bowls, or tacos al pastor . . . . if the deal is not finalized by game time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><br>Sign up for our newsletter!</p><p>The Major League Baseball Players Association is supporting the possible strike.</p><p>“Like thousands of ballpark workers across the country, Local 11’s members are a vital yet under-appreciated part of what makes our game great,” says a statement from the MLBPA. “They deserve to be treated fairly, and will continue to have 1,200 members of the MLBPA behind them.”</p><p>The previous contract expired in 2019, though the stadium was closed in 2020 and had limited capacity in 2021, so this is the first time the majority of the stadium employees were expected to return to work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vToaCsZZ2Wt7C%2BjKynqKqkqHq0wMCdoK6lXaKuunnNqKtmmpViwKa4y6KloGWRo8Zuss6om2anomKvpsLEq5ignaNisba%2ByKeeZqyYmnqjtcagnKysXZyurrGMqJ1mrJiaerSxwKymp2WVlsFuwMeiqmamn6l6tbTArWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
