The historical tale has also inspired a TV show, two plays and The Conjuring 2.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is The Enfield Poltergeist a fictionalised documentary?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eEdwNdd-e04B data-wc=59>The documentary will showcase a combination of over 250 hours of real audio footage while recreating the home and the family, reconstructing the true testimonies from those involved in the case with actors for a unique spin on a documentary.
