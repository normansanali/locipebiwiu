That theory crossed John Quincy Adams’ desk thanks to an Army officer with political connections named John Cleves Symmes, Jr.</p><p>Starting in 1818, Symmes had been re-popularizing the hoary notion that the Earth was hollow. What Symmes brought to the age-old Hollow Earth theory was the contention that there were openings thousands of miles wide at the Earth’s poles through which one could venture inside our planet.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137923 alt="John Cleves Symmes" width=584 height=713 data-sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/john-cleves-symmes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137923 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>John Cleves Symmes, Jr.</span></p><p>Symmes offered this idea in a number of published papers and via his lecture tours around the country, then finally sought to put together an expedition that would prove him right once and for all.</p><p>So, in the early 1820s, Symmes and some followers and associates lobbied Congress, Smithsonian <a href=# rel=noopener>writes</a>, time and again to fund their mission below the Earth’s crust. Congress, however, wouldn’t give them what they wanted.</p><p>President John Quincy Adams, on the other hand, approved Symmes’ mission. But by the time it began to materialize, Andrew Jackson was now president and the expedition was shot down.</p><p>Its proponents, however, kept trying and one man, Jeremiah Reynolds, successfully lobbied Congress for funding in 1936. By then, Reynolds and company had either shifted their beliefs, or at least pretended to, by pitching the South Pole-bound mission not as a Hollow Earth theory crusade but one focused on trade, whaling, and nationalistic pride.</p><p>That mission, of course, never uncovered any evidence to support the Hollow Earth theory, which fell out of whatever favor it had at around that same time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-137926 alt="Illustration Of Symmes's Theories" width=900 height=672 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/symmes-hole.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-137926 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration about Symmes’ theories, originally published in Harper’s in 1882.</span></p><p>But why did Adams ever sign off on a mission at least in part informed by such a theory? There seems to be no definitive evidence that Adams actually believed in the Hollow Earth theory.</p><p>But it’s possible, Smithsonian writes, that Adams, a keen naturalist, was simply inspired by the fact that such a mission might uncover new mysteries in a little-explored corner of our planet.</p><p>Adams was the man, after all, who helped create a national observatory (the oldest, still-operating scientific institution in America) and secure funding for the Smithsonian Institution. But perhaps Adams’ greatest scientific passion project was the one that he never quite managed to get off, or rather into, the ground.</p><p>After this look at the Hollow Earth theory and John Quincy Adams, check out the Adams photo that is the <a href=#>first-ever surviving photograph of a U.S. president</a>.
