"I had a good time at the Grammys," he said to put it plain and simple. The actor added that his wife, Jennifer Lopez, was attending, and he thought that it would be more fun than the award shows he usually attends since there would be music performances.</p><p dir=ltr>He then explained the <a href=#>conversation with Lopez</a> that fans have been trying to decode, mentioning that when Trevor Noah approached the two, he didn't know the cameras were filming. "I leaned into her and I was like, 'As soon they start rolling, I'm going to slide away from you and leave you sitting next to Trevor,'" he recalled. "She goes, 'You better f***ing not leave.'"</p><p>Previously, it was rumored that Affleck felt a little out of place at the award show, explaining his unenthused facial expressions throughout the night. "He definitely gravitated toward the other actors in the room the most — that seemed to be where he was the most comfortable," shared an editor at&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, adding that he still seemed like he was enjoying himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjZYV2fI6bnKdlkZuzrbHCpGScoJGhuLR51KlkoaGjYrStu86msGafopa6rsXSZpipqJWWv6K6wp5kraddl66vwMSrZLChpJ16q7HNp6CfnaJiubC8xLNm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
