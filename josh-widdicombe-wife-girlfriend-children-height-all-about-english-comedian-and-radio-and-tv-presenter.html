His stand-up comedy is way out of this world. Josh’s work for several TV networks and his number of successful shows made him the man he is today. He works for BBC’s BBC Three for a long time now. And the show is one of the favorites on the network. Famed for his work in the TV show, The Last Leg, he is one of the most sought comedians of the recent time. Contrary to his fame and popularity, the stand-up comedian has managed to enjoy a low-key personal life in public and in media.

While he knows to enjoy a private personal life, his girlfriend, on the other hand, is an open lady. His girlfriend regularly flaunts her romantic love life on her social pages, mostly on her Instagram account. The lady never holds back when it comes to expressing her love towards Josh and their kid. Speaking of the newest family member, Josh and his girlfriend recently welcomed their first child together.
