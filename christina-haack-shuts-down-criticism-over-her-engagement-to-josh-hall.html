Love you Josh.”</p><p>When it was first posted, the caption also included – a now deleted – 1.14.22, implying that the couple – who spent the holidays together in Tennessee with her children – might have already tied the knot, just four months after they announced their engagement in September 2021.</p><p>In November, the ‘Christina on the Coast’ star gushed about her “real and raw” relationship with Josh, labelling him “well-balanced”.</p><p>She said: “Everything with us is real and raw. We are on the same page with the same outlook on life. I love that Josh is a well-balanced man. He is a man who takes care of his woman and family and can handle anything that is thrown at him without letting it get to him.”</p><p>Christina added: “He has brought me back to my roots and reminded me what life is like outside of television. With him by my side, I believe anything is possible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnJ%2BroaOptq%2BtjKGYmpubYsCpwdOsZJ2np6N6pL7IraCcoaOierDCxKtkoZ2iYrKvs8CgnKadnql6tbuMo6asoF2drq24jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
