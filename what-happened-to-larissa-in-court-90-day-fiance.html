Source: InstagramThere's certainly never a shortage of drama on TLC's 90 Day FiancÃ©: Happily Ever After. There have been multiple marriages, divorces, babies, and arrests that result every season, making each reunion special a piece of must-see TV.Â 
On the July 28 reunion for Season 4 of the hit show, we got some answers about what happened during Larissa Dos Santos Lima's court appearance for domestic violence against ex Colt Johnson."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her dramatic trial ends.</h2><p>Larissa came to the U.S. from Brazil in order to be with software engineer Colt Johnson. She left behind her two children, who are still in Brazil, to try to make her relationship with Colt work. The two had a tumultuous romance, with Larissa constantly asking Colt for money, which she used for lip fillers, among other things.&nbsp;</p><p>Their relationship ended in a domestic violence incident in January. Larissa was arrested for attacking Colt, giving him a swollen lip and a bloody mouth. Larissa and Colt were separated at the time of the incident. Larissa claimed that the attack occurred because she had seen Colt buy a pornographic video, which led to an argument that escalated into physical violence.&nbsp;</p><p>Colt filed for divorce from Larissa later that week. In a controversial move, Larissa tried to start a campaign to raise money for her lawyers' fees. The campaign was shut down soon after.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>During the 'Tell All' reunion, we finally saw Larissa's last court appearance for the domestic violence case. She brought along her new boyfriend, Eric Nichols, and she ended up getting a fine and some community service for the incident.</p><p>Larissa had feared jail time and possible deportation, so she was pleased with the outcome. Colt, on the other hand, was disappointed in the result. His later comments about Larissa had some actually wondering if the pair were on their way toward a reconciliation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Colt and Larissa still together?</h2><p>Larissa does flaunt her relationship with Eric on Instagram, whom she met on a dating app shortly after the violent incident between her and Colt. The relationship has been widely criticized by fans, with many accusing the pair of faking it for publicity. Eric is seen on the show, and many are questioning his intentions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>ðŸ’– __________________________________ #90dayfiancehappilyeverafter #90dayfiance #smothie #squats #brazilianbutt #feet #nosillyhashtagstoday #postmalone</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Larissa Dos Santos Lima</a> (@larissalimareal) on Jul 3, 2019 at 8:25am PDT</p></figure><p>During the 'Tell All' episode of the show, Colt admitted that he still "f-----g loves Larissa" and he even lamented pulling the plug on their relationship. He claimed that they could have made it work if they took time to talk through their issues instead of passionately arguing. Larissa responded to her ex via a video call and said "never say never."&nbsp;</p><p>She later brought Eric out to sit with her on the video call, which seemed to quash any shot Colt still had with her. Colt seemed hurt about Larissa publicizing her relationship with Eric, and he said that he felt like he was actually finally done with her.&nbsp;</p><p>There still seems to be some unresolved feelings between Larissa and Colt, which will surely play out on future episodes of the show. 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? airs on Sundays at 8 p.m. on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSlmaKewLStjKKlZpufqr%2B1eZhpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
