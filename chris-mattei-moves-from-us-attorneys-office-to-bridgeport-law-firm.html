He is a welcome addition to our trial team.”</p><p>In his positions at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Mattei oversaw all white-collar, federal criminal investigations and prosecutions in the State of Connecticut. He directed the Connecticut Public Corruption Task Force, a multi-agency investigative unit tasked with detecting and prosecuting corruption at all levels of government.</p><p>In 2014, Mattei helped prosecute former Gov. John G. Rowland. Prior to that, he prosecuted a bribery ring, resulting in the conviction of seven individuals, including Robert Braddock Jr., the finance director for a U.S. congressional campaign. Most recently, Mattei prosecuted high-ranking public officials for accepting kickbacks and engaging in fraud, and a Ridgefield osteopath for health-care fraud.</p><p>Mattei, a graduate of Georgetown University who received his lawdegree from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 2005, will be joining Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder in October.</p><p>Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder has offices in Bridgeport, Danbury and New Haven.
