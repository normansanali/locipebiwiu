Then companies like Britax, Baby Jogger and Peg Perego started to realize that it was possible to make a tricked-out baby stroller that wasn’t so heavy you needed a strong <a href=#>dumbell game</a> to lift it. And now, dear parents, meet the new Bugaboo stroller, which weighs as much as a Kitchenaid artisan stand mixer.</p><p>City parents (or those with bad backs) craving a fancypants model will be happy to know that Bugaboo, the Dutch company whose wheels are posh enough for the progeny of Beyoncé, Elton John and Amy Poehler, has launched the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Bugaboo Lynx</a>, its lightest and most affordable full-size luxury stroller to date.</p><p>Weighs in at just 20.7 pounds (thank you, sleek aircraft-grade aluminum frame) and costing $899, the Lynx can hold a child from birth up to 50 pounds, and has a five-point harness that’s easy to adjust (read: no rethreading) when your child has a growth spurt. The bottom basket has a generous 22-pound weight limit, which is handy for those who like to jam it full of groceries (because hi, multitasking).</p><p>Considering the Lynx? Here are some other key facts to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The Lynx works easily with Bugaboo’s car seat, the Turtle by Nuna (no adapter required), or you can purchase an adapter to use with certain brands like Maxi-Cosi, Cybex or Clek.</li><li>If you want a bassinet for the Lynx, you’ll need to buy it separately for $250. This is different from the Bugaboo Fox, which costs $300 more but comes with a bassinet that’s approved for overnight sleeping (the one for the Lynx is not).</li><li>The seat has three positions—upright, semi-reclined and fully reclined—and can face either in towards the parent or out to the world.</li><li>The stroller can be easily folded with the seat attached (great if you’re at a restaurant) or without it, for a more compact footprint (like when you want to store it in a closet at home). Either way, it can stand on its own.</li><li>The handlebar is adjustable, which makes life easier if baby’s caregivers are a mix of different heights.</li><li>There’s an extra-large sun canopy made with a peekaboo window: It can be opened to allow air flow through the top mesh panel, and fully extended to guard tender skin from UV rays.</li><li>Suspension in the front wheels provide a less bumpy ride, and the wheels themselves are also puncture proof.</li><li>The Lynx is compatible with Bugaboo’s <a href=# rel=noreferrer>wheeled board</a>, which offers a spot for an older child to sit and can be bought separately for $125.</li></ul><p>Note that simply purchasing the Bugaboo Lynx will not automatically make you as cool as its namesake, a sleek, giant-pawed predator cat who can spot a mouse from 250 feet away. But a parent can dream.</p><p>Every product on Fatherly is independently selected by our editors, writers, and experts.
