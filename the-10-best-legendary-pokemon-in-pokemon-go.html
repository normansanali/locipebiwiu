It goes without saying that collecting the truly powerful and Legendary Pokémon is a crucial necessity for any self-respecting Pokémon team. There are many powerful Legendaries in the game, but some undoubtedly outshine the others, and catching them can make all the difference. Here are ten Legendary Pokémon that reign over the Pokémon world.</p><h2 id=h-1-darkrai data-injectable=false>1. Darkrai</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pokemon-go-darkrai-e1706637883586.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>Darkrai ranks lowest out of the strongest Legendary Pokémon due to its multiple weaknesses. Fighting, Bug, and Fairy type moves will inflict some devastating damage on Darkrai. In fact, those specific move types deal 160% more damage than others, making Darkrai incredibly weak against it. But despite its apparent shortcomings, this Dark type Pokémon deals 63 percent more damage against Ghost, Dark, and Psychic types.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>In the game, the best moves for Darkrai are&nbsp;Snarl&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shadow Ball. The Pokémon that give trainers the highest chance of capture are Lucario,&nbsp;Zacian (Crowned Sword),&nbsp;Urshifu (Single Strike),&nbsp;Urshifu (Rapid Strike), and Conkeldurr. While one might find it difficult to first catch and then go through the arduous task of training these Pokémon, this test of patience is worth it when the time comes to encounter a Darkrai.</p><h2 id=h-2-registeel data-injectable=false>2. Registeel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Registeel.jpg><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>Gen 3 really did have some of the coolest looking and most powerful legendaries out there. Aside from that though Registeel is also pretty durable with a great deal of defense, however, it does suffer from a very low attack stat (Registeel only does one point of damage per turn). Its strongest move is Metal Claw and Flash Cannon is pretty good too.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Most of Registeels moves are steel type (duh) but it has a few fighting and electric type moves which makes for a slightly more versatile move set especially when compared to Registeel’s siblings, Regice and Regirock, both of whom have similar defensive capabilities but lack decent attacks.</p><h2 id=h-3-heatran data-injectable=false>3. Heatran</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pogo-heatran.webp><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>While Heatran is currently not the most popular or common legendary, however, taking advantage of its strengths makes it a potent tank of a Fire-type, even though its attacks aren’t the most powerful. Its wide range of resistances gives Heatran tank-like abilities. Due to this, Heatran is able to simultaneously inflict higher damage and defend himself against Grass, Bug, Fairy, Ice, and Steel types.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>The first time Heatran appeared was in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl’s post-game area, Stark Mountain. One of its most notable characteristics is that it can be either a male or female Legendary Pokémon.<br>Currently, Heatran is also the only fire and steel-type Pokémon. The combination of the fire and steel types supports the idea that Heatran was based on volcanoes; the fire type refers to the lava, while the steel type refers to the earth’s core.</p><h2 id=h-4-kyurem data-injectable=false>4. Kyurem</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Kyruem.png><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Dragon types are without a doubt one of the best in Pokémon in general and you can rest assured this won’t be the last time you see a dragon type legendary on this list. Kyurem first appeared in the Gen V Pokémon games, representing the concept of wuji, meaning the absence of yin and yang.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>However, what makes Kyurem stand out amongst the rest on this list is that it’s also an ice type, meaning its attacks can be particularly effective against flying, ground and grass types. Kyurem is also resistant to water, electric and grass attacks.</p><h2 id=h-5-reshiram data-injectable=false>5. Reshiram</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Reshiram-1.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Known as the mascot of Pokemon Black, Reshiram is the first of the Tao Trio to arrive in Pokémon Go. This trio of Pokémon has been heavily influenced by Taoism’s concept of yin and yang, as their names suggest. Due to its white color and fire type, Reshiram represents yang in this triumvirate.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>The Fire-type Reshiram debuted with a high attack stat, plus a lot of solid stats in general, along with a powerful move set, eclipsing the rest of the Fire-types in the PvE scene at the time of its release (excluding Shadows). As a Fire- and Dragon-type Pokémon, Reshiram is vulnerable to Ground-, Rock-, and Dragon-type attacks.</p><h2 id=h-6-terrakion data-injectable=false>6. Terrakion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Terrakion.png><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>One of if not the best fighting type out there, Terrakion’s quick moves like Double Kick work in tandem with charged attacks such as Rock Slide to make this Pokémon pretty formidable. Of course, Terrakion isn’t just a fighter type, with a good selection of rock type moves too.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Introduced in gen 5 along with three other legendaries known as the Swords of Justice, Terrakion is arguably the best of the group, although Cobalion, Keldeo and Virizion are all pretty great fighting types too.</p><h2 id=h-7-dialga data-injectable=false>7. Dialga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dialga.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Dialga is a legendary dual-type Steel & Dragon Pokémon. It’s vulnerable to Fighting and Ground moves. For catching Dialga, the strongest five Pokémon to charge into battle with are Lucario,&nbsp;Urshifu (Rapid Strike),&nbsp;Urshifu (Single Strike),&nbsp;Landorus (Therian), and Conkeldurr. To be safe, Lucario is the best bet due to its Fighting-type moves that help counterattack with some super effective damage.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Additionally, Dialga deals 63% damage against eight different types: Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Water, Electric, and Psychic, making it a worthy opponent against the most common types.</p><h2 id=h-8-zygarde data-injectable=false>8. Zygarde</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zygarde.jpg><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>This dragon/ground type has a decent arsenal of attacks, although its best move has to be Dragon Tail, which is both high in speed and pretty great in terms of damage (it also forces your opponent to switch out their Pokémon). Zygarde also has a pretty high HP so even though the rest of it’s attacks tend to be a little underwhelming, it’s still a tank in battle, especially in PVP scenarios, although PVE is not this Pokémon’s forte.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>This legendary Pokémon was introduced in gen 6 and it has multiple forms, these being Zygarde 10%, 50%, and Complete Forme. Obviously Complete Forme is the strongest. Before players can use the final form they will need to start out at 10% and collect Zygarde cells in order to make it more powerful.</p><h2 id=h-9-zekrom data-injectable=false>9. Zekrom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Zekrom.jpg><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Zekrom is a dual-type Dark and Electric Pokémon vulnerable to&nbsp;Dragon, Fairy, Ground, and Ice-type moves.&nbsp;Zekrom&nbsp;is boosted by&nbsp;Windy and Rain&nbsp;weather. While it has more weaknesses compared to Dialga, the main trait that makes Zekrom a must-have is its 63% damage potential against the three main types ⏤ Fire, Water, and Grass ⏤ along with Steel and Flying. Again, these are common types that only have certain weaknesses, so Zekrom is an all-rounder for dealing damage.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>When attempting to capture Zekrom, the five strongest Pokémon to arm yourself with are Kyurem (Black),&nbsp;Darmanitan (Galarian Zen),&nbsp;Palkia,&nbsp;Rayquaza, and&nbsp;Salamence. Kyurem in particular deals 100 percent effective damage, making it an ideal opponent for anyone hoping to add Zekrom to their Pokédex. For a more statistically accurate analysis, Zekrom’s strongest moves are Charge Beam & Wild Charge, and it has a Max CP of 4,038, making it exceptionally strong.</p><h2 id=h-10-lugia data-injectable=false>10. Lugia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lugia.jpg><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Hands down the coolest gen 2 Pokémon, Lugia is the master of the legendary trio of birds, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. It’s strong wings can create strong gusts of wind pwerful enough to destroy buildings.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Lugia is a flying/psychic type with a long list of great attack moves, Aeroblast, Dragon Tail, Sky Attack are just a few of this legendary’s moves. Unfortunately, compared to other flying types or psychic types, it’s move set is noticeably not as strong as others. That being said, Lugia is still a beast, and Aeroblast is one of the most powerful moves in the game.</p><h2 id=h-11-kyogre data-injectable=false>11. Kyogre</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kyogre.jpg><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Kyogre, the Water-type Legendary, deals 63% more damage against Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice types but can be 160 percent weaker against Grass and Electric types. The best moves for Kyogre are&nbsp;Waterfall&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hydro Pump, and since Water-type Legendaries are few and far between, Kyogre is a one-in-a-million catch.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>If one is seeking to catch Kyogre, the Pokémon for the job are Thundurus (Therian),&nbsp;Zekrom,&nbsp;Deoxys (Attack),&nbsp;Deoxys (Normal), and Zacian (Crowned Sword). Thundurus is the best choice, considering Electric-type moves are super effective against Water-type Pokémon.</p><h2 id=h-12-groudon data-injectable=false>12. Groudon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Groudon.jpg><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Groudon is a Ground-type Pokémon but also possesses some Dragon-type moves even though it isn’t registered as a dual-type Pokémon. Dragon Tail and Earthquake are the best moves to equip oneself with before going up against Groudon. Ground-type Pokémon are weak against&nbsp;Water,&nbsp;Grass,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ice&nbsp;moves. Like Kyogre, Groudon, being a Ground-type Legendary, is hard to find and even harder to catch.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Groudon deals 63% more damage against Poison, Rock, and Electric types, which are some of the hardest types to counter. To catch Groudon, Water, and Ice types are the most efficient, including Darmanitan (Galarian Zen),&nbsp;Kingler,&nbsp;Darmanitan (Galarian Standard), and Zarude. You can also take the assistance of Kyogre, i.e., a Water-type Legendary, as one of the easiest ways to capture a Legendary is with another Legendary.</p><h2 id=h-13-giratina data-injectable=false>13. Giratina</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Giratina.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>Giratina takes the third spot for its impressive range of resistant Pokémon types. As a dual-type Ghost and Dragon Pokémon, Giratina deals 63% more damage against a larger range of foes, including Poison, Bug, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Normal, and Fighting. Giratina is only weak against Ghost, Ice, Dragon, Dark, and Fairy, which are the drastically less common types in comparison.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>For Giratina, its best moves are Shadow Claw and Dragon Claw. The best Pokémon match-ups to defeat (and capture) Giratina are Kyurem (Black),&nbsp;Zacian (Crowned Sword),&nbsp;Darmanitan (Galarian Zen),&nbsp;Palkia, and Rayquaza. We don’t need to remind ardent Pokémon Go players that catching these mighty Legendaries requires a strong Pokémon party.</p><h2 id=h-14-rayquaza data-injectable=false>14. Rayquaza</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rayquaza.jpg><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Rayquaza, like Giratina, counters many different types and also has fewer weaknesses, making it deserving of the second spot. As a dual-type Dragon and Flying Pokémon, Rayquaza is resistant to Fighting, Bug, Fire, Water, Ground, and Grass ⏤ yet again the more common types to find in grasslands. Rayquaza is weak against Ice, Rock, Dragon, and Fairy, which is one less than Giratina. Rayquaza can also be used to capture many other Legendaries.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>For capturing Rayquaza, Ice and Dragon types are the top picks. Darmanitan (Galarian Zen),&nbsp;Darmanitan (Galarian Standard),&nbsp;Kyurem (Black),&nbsp;Mamoswine, and Weavile will get the job done, especially if they have been trained properly and their CP has been boosted to their maximum. When capturing Rayquaza, be aware that Ice deals 256% more damage than any other type, making it a must-have for taking on a Dragon/Flying type.</p><h2 id=h-15-mewtwo data-injectable=false>15. Mewtwo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mewtwo.jpg><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo</a> has long been considered the gold standard for Legendary Pokémon. As a Psychic type, Mewtwo is resistant to Fighting types and other Psychic types. However, Ghost, Bug, and Dark-type moves will manage to deal some damage <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">against it in battle</a>. While the primary best moves for Mewtwo are Confusion and Psystrike, it’s known as the superior Legendary because of its ability to learn actions of many different types.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>In addition to Psychic-type moves, Mewtwo can learn Fire, Ice, Electric, Fighting, Ghost, and Normal-type moves, meaning that its capabilities far exceed those of other Legendary Pokémon. The strongest Pokémon that can beat Mewtwo are Chandelure,&nbsp;Gengar,&nbsp;Gengar (Costume 2020),&nbsp;Dragapul, and &nbsp;Darkrai, as Mewtwo is the weakest against Ghost types. Due to its massive range of moves, Mewtwo is almost guaranteed to deal effective damage against any Pokémon it faces.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>Now that you’re armed with the wisdom of the best Legendary Pokémon out therem get ready to catch ’em all!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXWZ9bq7ErKtmpJWcsq%2BwwKuwZqifoLKuu81moKdloKS4prnOp2Sgp18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
