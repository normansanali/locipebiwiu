Sam Snow and Kit Casey, two animal <a href=#>detectives</a>, investigate cases involving animals in this season’s tale. Sam Snow and his partner Kit Casey investigate monster cases given to them by their director. Sam Snow and Agent Kit Casey have been tasked with investigating rhino poaching. Upon discovering Jenny, who would eat almost anything, bugs being her favorite, two agents set out on a mission to discover the source. She tells them the watering hall is full of tasty bugs, but they let just the rhino in. A security guard refuses to let them in, explaining that the event is private and that they have caused enough disturbance enough. The kit uses rhino language to convince the guard to let them in.</p><p>They wonder who would dare to harm a fully grown rhino. After realizing that the agents are the only visitors who haven’t been invited, the rhino squad begins to suspect them. Rita’s back provides a trail of evidence, and four muddy footprints are discovered behind her. Things take a strange turn as another lone rhino goes on a raze. Sam stands taller than Kit as he reveals another clue: the rhino poaching began in a wooded area. They learn that another rhino has seen something run away, thanks to the information he provides. Like a cat, but smaller, this creature had a pointed snout and was covered in black markings. Sam thinks it’s probably a leopard. If you enjoy mysteries and want to piece together evidence, you should watch The Creature Cases to learn who killed the rhinos. Ultimately, this is all the data about season 2 of The Creature Cases on Netflix.
