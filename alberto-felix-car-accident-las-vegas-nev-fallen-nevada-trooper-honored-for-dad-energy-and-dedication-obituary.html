One name that resonated within the force and the community was Trooper Alberto Felix. His dedication to duty and unique approach to law enforcement left a lasting impact on those he served. As we gather to remember and honor Trooper Felix at his memorial service, it becomes evident that he was more than just a uniformed officer; he was a mentor, a friend, and, as Jonah Ayat recalls, “the dad version” of a law enforcer.</p><p>Late one evening on a bustling Las Vegas freeway, Jonah Ayat found himself in the headlights of Trooper Alberto Felix’s patrol car. The flashing lights and the blaring siren indicated that Ayat’s speeding had not gone unnoticed. Bracing himself for a ticket, Ayat rolled down his window, expecting a stern-faced officer ready to mete out justice. However, what he got was far from the conventional law enforcement experience.</p><p>Trooper Felix approached Ayat with a demeanor that transcended the typical traffic stop. Instead of handing out a citation, Felix engaged Ayat in a heartfelt conversation. He delivered a stern but caring lecture, offering advice and guidance as though he were a concerned father rather than a law enforcer. This unexpected encounter left Ayat with a sense of gratitude and admiration for the man behind the badge.</p><p>As Ayat fondly remembers, Trooper Felix was the “dad version” of a law enforcement officer. Beyond the stern exterior and authoritative presence, Felix possessed a compassionate and empathetic side that endeared him to those he interacted with. It wasn’t just about enforcing the law for Felix; it was about making a positive impact on people’s lives.&nbsp;Throughout his career, Trooper Felix became known for his unique approach to community policing. He believed in building bridges between law enforcement and the public, fostering trust and understanding. His ability to connect with people on a personal level, offering not just warnings but genuine advice and encouragement, set him apart in a profession that often sees officers as enforcers first and foremost.</p><p>Trooper Alberto Felix was more than just a figure of authority; he was a mentor and a friend to many in the Nevada State Police force. Colleagues and subordinates speak of his willingness to guide and support them, instilling a sense of camaraderie within the ranks. Beyond the uniform, Trooper Felix was a person who genuinely cared about the well-being of those around him.&nbsp;As we gather at Central Christian Church in Henderson to pay our respects and bid farewell to Trooper Felix, it’s essential to remember the human behind the badge. His legacy extends beyond the countless traffic stops and law enforcement actions. Trooper Alberto Felix leaves behind a legacy of compassion, mentorship, and community engagement that serves as a shining example for the law enforcement community and beyond.</p><p>The memory of Trooper Alberto Felix will forever linger in the hearts of those he served and the colleagues he inspired. His unique approach to law enforcement, characterized by empathy and understanding, transcended the traditional roles of a police officer. As we say our goodbyes, let us not just remember Trooper Felix for his duty but celebrate the compassionate and caring individual who touched the lives of many, leaving a positive and lasting impression on the Nevada State Police force and the community he served.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJmcl7KzwM5mnZ6kma16pK3RZpicm5mZsq%2FAjKWYrGWmmrSiv4ynnK9llpa5rbHNZqWerpGZrm7A0aimqZ2iYrWwus6rnJ1llqS%2FbrDAnWSeppWntLp5wKebZpyVmbakrdOipqdln5e2tcHAq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
