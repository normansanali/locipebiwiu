Since his debut on TV, Darrell has been actively involved in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Darrell Sheets’ net worth has been reported to be $5 million, primarily earned from his significant income from A&E Network and the considerable sums he has garnered from his discoveries in storage lockers. Some of his notable findings include rare collections of comics, a letter written by Abraham Lincoln, and several paintings by Pablo Picasso.</p><h3>Darrell Sheets’ Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>While Darrell was raised in San Diego, he currently resides in North Hollywood. His interest in abandoned storage lockers and containers emerged in his 20s, and over the past 30-plus years, he has consistently made profits from them. In 2010, he was invited to participate in the TV program “Storage Wars” as the main star, which significantly contributed to his net worth. The concept of the reality series revolves around making a profit by purchasing abandoned storage locker contents and selling them for a substantial gain.</p><p>It is noteworthy that storage lockers in California are rented for only three months, and if the rent is not paid, the contents are auctioned off. The buyers have only a quick look from the open door before the contents are sold as a whole.</p><p>The show features main buyers including Darrel Sheets, his son Brandon, Jarrod Schulz and Brandi Passante, Dave Hester, Ivy Calvin, Rene and Casey Nezhoda, as well as Mary Padian. Darrell’s personality has made him a popular figure on the show, known for his sharp tongue, emotional bidding, and characteristic saying “This is the WOW factor!” His personal website serves as an online store where he sells items purchased from the show’s auctions, managed by his wife. “Storage Wars” has garnered high ratings, with over two million viewers initially and more than 5.1 million by the third season.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Sheets maintains a private profile and is known to keep his personal life to himself. While there have been rumors about his sexuality, it is known that he has been married twice, and has two children from his first marriage and two stepchildren from his second marriage with his wife and business partner, Kimber.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Darrell Sheets</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 13, 1958</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Diego, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>TV personality, storage hunter, businessman</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kimber Sheets</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Brandon Sheets</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/public/Darrell-Sheets</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/DarrellGambler</a></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/darrell/sheets</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm4207078</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Storage Wars: “The Candyman Can’t”, “All About Evel”, ”The Bargain Hunters”, ”The Mogu”, ”Rachael Ray” (2006-), ”The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Storage Wars</td><td>2010-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Rachael Ray</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Guest</td></tr><tr><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiuoZmkYra0edOhnGamlal6uLvRrZ9mp5ZisaK%2B0Z6jpWWjnbKmwNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
