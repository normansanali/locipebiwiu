And then when it came back, I was like, ‘Oh, this is my chance.’ And when I finally got a chance to do stand-up on there, to me that was like, ‘I made it.

The service, which she called her “Black Mitzvah,” took place on her 40th birthday and inspired a Netflix special.</p><p class=p1>“It’s called <i>Black Mitzvah</i> for a reason — because I’m Black, and on that same day, I’m gonna have my bat mitzvah, and then I’ll be an official grown woman,” she said in an Instagram video. “‘And what do you mean you’re Black and you’re having a bat mitzvah, Tiffany?’ Well, don’t know if y’all know this about me, but I’m Jewish. I’m Jewish by DNA. I did my 23 & Me.”</p><p class=p1>She noted: “So, because of my father, I want to honor him and our ancestors. I want to do something that represents growth and maturity. And I want to teach. That’s what I’ve been put on this planet to do: teach. And Judaism is <i>all</i> about that: teaching, learning, sharing stories.”</p><h3 class=p1><b>March 2021</b></h3><p class=p1>Haddish has been <a href=#>nominated for two Grammy Awards</a>, taking home her first trophy at the 2021 ceremony for her narration of her <i>Black Mitzvah </i>comedy album.
