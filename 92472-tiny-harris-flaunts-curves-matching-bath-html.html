It is expensive, though. But it worked."</p><p class=dh>While Tiny did not reveal when he had T.I. followed, it may be assumed that it was either in 2017, where he allegedly had an affair with Bernice Burgos, or more recently, after a fan who had access backstage filmed him slapping Asia'h Epperson on the butt last June during one of his shows.</p><p class=dh>T.I.'s cheating scandal went viral on the internet just before Father's Day, which made him miss out on spending time with his kids with Tiny. Likewise, he did not get a birthday greeting from any of them, including his own wife.</p><p class=dh>Despite being baned from the Harris household for now, T.I. chose to spend time with his other son during Father's Day, all the way in South Africa. Ya Majesty Harris just recently graduated from high school, and his father made sure to take him on a graduation trip for all his accomplishments.</p><p class=dh>After everything that has been going on in the Harris household, Tiny seemed to be in good spirits while speaking to her best friend on the show. She has not been having the greatest of times, especially after her alleged affair with Asia'h. In 2016 and 2017, Harris was ready to leave her marriage behind by filing for divorce, but it was always put on hold and the couple tried to work things out.</p><p class=dh>Now, only time could tell if the couple can still fix whatever issues they have with one another. Hopefully, they do figure things out for the sake of their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJpbW9iYsGquthmn5qqop7AbrLLmqynrKNisLa%2B1Z6qZqWRqbCptc2gZJuZpJ17qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
