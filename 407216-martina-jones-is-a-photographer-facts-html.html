She is talented in her craft and displays some of her work on social media alongside her personal posts.</p><p class=Fg>Although the daughter of a music icon, Martina Jones carved her own unique path in the creative industry. She once followed her mother's footsteps as a model but changed her career route.</p><p class=Fg>She has made her father proud, which he expressed on social media. The two share a close relationship. The photographer even shared how grateful she was to have Quincy Jones as a dad in a sweet post.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Martina Jones Is One of Quincy Jones' Seven Children</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>On November 1, 1966, Quincy Jones and his then-Swedish model partner, Ulla Andersson, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/all-about-quincy-jones-kids/>welcomed</a> Martina. At that time, the couple already had <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Q/IdidgShgxQcC>marital problems</a> but still chose to raise their daughter in a loving home. Unfortunately, Martina's parents' marriage only lasted a few years, from 1967 to 1974. She then went to live under her mother's wing in Sweden.</p><p class=Fg>Martina has six <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/all-about-quincy-jones-kids/>siblings</a>, Jolie, Rachel, Quincy III, Kidada, Rashida, and Kenya. Jolie, the eldest <a class="Xd a" href=#>child</a>, was born during their father's marriage to his first wife, Jeri Caldwell. Meanwhile, Rachel resulted from their father's brief affair with Carol Reynolds.</p><p class=Fg>Following Martina's birth, Quincy and Ulla welcomed Quincy III, the singer's only son. In the '70s, Quincy and his third wife, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Peggy Lipton</a>, welcomed two daughters, Kidada and <a class="Xd a" href=#>Rashida Jones</a>. Martina's youngest sister, Kenya, was born in 1993 to Quincy and his then-partner, Nastassja Kinski.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Martina Jones Shares Some of Her Photographs on Social Media</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>After living in Sweden for some time, Martina returned to the USA to live with her dad. She first studied dance before following in her mother's footsteps as a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428779/>model</a>. However, she developed a profound interest in photography and pursued it as a career. Some of her works are displayed on her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/martinafotos1/>Instagram</a> alongside her other personal interests.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Martina Jones Has a Good Relationship with Her Father</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Having a famous father in the entertainment industry meant he was often away from home while Martina was growing up. Despite his busy work schedule and many kids, Quincy tried to keep a close <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxWgouWAIEI">relationship</a> with all of them.</p><p class=Fg>However, one of his children <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/02/rashida-jones-i-didnt-know-if-i-was-coming-or-going>once acknowledged</a> that he was a different parent to each of his children, as his older children would describe him as never being around, while his younger children had him around a lot more.</p><p class=Fg>Martina deeply appreciates and loves her father and pays tribute to him several times, including his birthday, which she calls one of her favorite times of the year. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CbGMAYvvpHH/>wrote</a> in a post:</p><p class=Fg>"I love you every day, but I send you a little extra today as I am so happy you were born and that I get to call you Daddy."</p><p class=Fg>Similarly, Quincy posted about Martina and once praised her for being passionate about everything she pursues. "I truly admire that," he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/QuincyJones/photos/happy-birthday-to-my-daughter-tina-youve-always-had-such-a-fire-for-everything-y/10154624350359631/>said</a>. "Love you so much, honey!" He also once shared a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgExrWnh1tc/>photo</a> with all his kids, expressing his pride for being their dad. <a class="Xd a" href=#>Quincy Jones</a> turned 90 this year, a milestone he didn't think he would celebrate, and he praised God for all the blessings in his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1ncGpha3qurdGtoKeZXZ%2B8r7HSZqCsZZFivam706ieq5mgnbKzecWamq2rXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
