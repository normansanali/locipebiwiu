L. Brock</a>, another mystery emerged in Port Charles, centered around her step-daughter, Terry Brock (Robyn Bernard). Bobbie and her then-boyfriend Jake Meyer (Sam Behrens) owned a brownstone, and the tenants included Terry and two brothers: Patrick and Kevin O'Connor (Guy Mack and Kevin Bernhardt). The three youthful residents had all known each other because they grew up in a town called Laurelton, but a scandal involving Terry put the boys at odds. She had issues like hypoglycemia and sleepwalking, and soon bodies started piling up in the Brownstone. Ultimately, everything linked back to murders that occurred in Laurelton, and the killer turned out to be Kevin! Despite Terry's annoying whininess, this shocking reveal is an important part of "General Hospital" history, as anyone — including a friend, brother, or fiancé — could be a murderer.</p><p>This storyline harkens back to horror maestro Mario Bava's 1964 film, "Blood and Black Lace," in which the killer turned out to be someone the main characters knew and least suspected. When D.L. died, his killer was revealed almost immediately. However, with the Brownstone killings, audiences were on edge right up until the tense, final showdown, where Kevin calmly but evilly pursued Terry until she knocked him off a cliff. Bernhardt would go on to be in "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth" in 1992 and write and produce several films after this edge-of-your-seat storyline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kGxqa29ibXyosc2eqZqkXZ28tLzIrZilZZKawLV5zK6pnZ2iYrq6v9OeqaKdo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
