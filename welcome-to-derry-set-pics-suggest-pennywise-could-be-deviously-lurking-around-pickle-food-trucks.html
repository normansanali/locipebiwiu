But before exclusive behind-the-scenes images are launched, fans are first being rewarded with a few intriguing set pics.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Over on the r/horror subreddit, user u/Dances-with-Scissors happily shared several images from the set of the much-anticipated horror series — which is currently filming in Toronto, Canada, right now. The three images showcase a handful of food vendors and markets that children back in the ‘50s typically hung around. You can check out the post for yourself down below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><a href=#>The new IT miniseries is being filmed at the top of my street.</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Dances-with-Scissors</a> in <a href=#>horror</a></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Among the images, the first pic highlights a pickle food truck called Melvin’s. Considering the Losers Club is notorious for hanging around the streets of Derry during the events of It, it would certainly make sense that kids from the ‘50s were hanging around the same spots — which would only mean that Pennywise is lurking nearby just waiting to feast.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=false>Of course, these images are merely minor details at this point, but it shouldn’t be long before showrunner Andy Muschietti shares an array of eye-popping images that will simply increase the series’ growing hype. We’ll have to wait and find out when Welcome to Derry arrives on HBO Max in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4scucpqadXam8brDEq6myZaOawW68yJyqZqulnLSmv9Nmp56mnq7Eqr%2FEZpqorZyZeqOxjJ2cr6GfqsCtxYylrKujmaO0bq3RqKynnF2ltqS3y55kn6efmXq1vtScoqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
