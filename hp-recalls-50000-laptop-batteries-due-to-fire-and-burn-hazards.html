HP does not provide any exact model numbers of laptops or battery packs that are affected but advises customers who own a potentially affected notebook to visit an <a href=#>appropriate website</a> and download a special utility (<a href=#>basic version</a>, <a href=#>full version</a>) that automatically checks whether or not a particular battery is potentially unsafe.</p><p>If the HP battery program validation utility finds that the accumulator in use needs to be replaced, it will recommend to update system’s BIOS and enable “Battery Safety Mode” that prevents it from charging. After that, customers should contact HP and order a new battery that will be sent to them free of charge. For laptops with internal batteries, HP will also provide a technician to switch them.</p><p>Battery recalls are not uncommon these days. This is the <a href=#>second laptop battery recall by HP</a> in the last 12 months. In January 2017, the company recalled 100,000 units. Since in many cases the batteries that explode or catch fire cause injury and/or property damage, HP is taking the issue with very seriously and is trying to avoid any incidents.</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5zfpJpZqGoXaeypK3LpapmbWBlfXF5y5qnraegYq%2BiwNOeqaKdo2KxtrGMraZmnpmnsm6tzZ1km62io3qprdmaqZ2r</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
