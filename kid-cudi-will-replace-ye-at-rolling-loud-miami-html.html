Kanye West may have canceled his Rolling Loud Miami set, but he still showed up to <a href=#>Lil Durk</a>’s. Ye previously pulled out of the music festival a week before he was scheduled to perform, and Kid Cudi was subsequently announced as the new headliner. Unfortunately, it seems that some audience members weren’t interested in being respectful to a replacement; Cudi ended up ending his set early because people were <a href=#>throwing things at him</a>. “If I get hit with one more fucking thing, if I see one more fucking thing on this fucking stage, I’m leaving,” he said shortly after he was hit in the head by what appeared to be a water bottle. “Don’t fuck with me.” Yet almost immediately after he issued the warning, another object went sailing onto the stage. As promised, Cudi walked off. Ye then made a surprise appearance on the opposite stage with Durk to perform “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” — a song that originally features Cudi. Ye and Cudi are already feuding over Donda 2, Pete Davidson, and who gets custody of Pusha T. We can’t imagine that this Rolling Loud situation has helped.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cudi gets hit and walks off stage at <a href=#>#RollingLoudMiami</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2sg8tmBGiS</a></p>— cole (@_coIe) <a href=#>July 23, 2022</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Durk brings out Ye at Rolling Loud <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TXt62Nvtfs</a></p>— Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) <a href=#>July 23, 2022</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5xetobl000q3b6vpf0udwlr@published data-word-count=7>Original story published July 17, 2022 follows.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5xet98m000m3b6v9cck96eg@published data-word-count=156>Swings and roundabouts, people. Swings and roundabouts. Ye may have <a href=#>taken Kid Cudi off Donda 2</a>, but Cudi is now replacing Ye as the headliner for night one of Rolling Loud Miami. Kanye West, also known as Ye, pulled out of Rolling Loud Miami on July 17, less than a week before the event. Luckily, Kid Cudi was there to step in. “We were looking forward to Ye headlining Rolling Loud Miami 2022. We spent months working with him and his team on the performance. Unfortunately, Ye has decided that he will no longer be performing,” Rolling Loud co-founders Tariq Cherif and Matt Zingler said in a statement. “This is the first time a headliner has ever pulled off our show and though we don’t take it lightly, we wish him the best. We look forward to welcoming Kid Cudi as a headliner in Miami and we can’t wait to see what he has in store.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5pvny1c000w3b6vjijxo19u@published data-word-count=46>This isn’t even the only cancellation-related drama Ye has going on right now. He is currently <a href=#>being sued</a> by Phantom Labs for over $7 million, money Ye was supposed to pay the company from his Coachella set fee.

Ye and Cudi were buds, until West decided Cudi was too chummy with Pete Davidson. So he pulled Cudi off Donda 2. Cudi addressed the situation when Pusha T’s “Rock and Roll” dropped, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, “I did this song a year ago when I was still cool w Kanye.&nbsp;I am not cool w that man.&nbsp;He’s not my friend and I only cleared the song for Pusha cuz thats my guy.” The beef remains, at least publicly, un-squashed.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cky31nx160000vuoq5onbov1u@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Weeknd Will Replace Ye as Coachella 2022 Headliner</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl26rs2p40000rfncy6p0q3a9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Kid Cudi’s Friendship Ended With Ye, Now Pusha T Is His Best Friend</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl5lqgpmc0000pkna3k8efuev@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Ye Sued for $7 mil, Wants to Befriend the GAP</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Kid Cudi Walks Off Stage During Rolling Loud Miami</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dgbHystcNmmq6cmWLEqrjLZqmeqJyWsKZ52J5kmqxdp7ytuMinnmakn6qxbrnImqSiZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
