You can also get this deal on Tuesday-Friday, but Monday is when we're hurting from the weekend. While a no-cost Swedish cafeteria breakfast served up by a furniture-in-a-box warehouse should, by most rational measure, sound like a&nbsp;<a href=#>one-way ticket to the Lockig</a>, the Atlantic Station icon delivers a decent morning meal that will fill you up without sending you into a personal Game of Thrones mid-commute. The cafeteria opens at 9:30 a.m., and breakfast ends at 11 a.m.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8><a href=#>IKEA</a>, Atlantic Station<br>441 16th St. NW<br>404-745-4532</p><p class=story-text data-index=9><b>Monday Night Brewing Tour</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=11>There is very clearly no better day in which to tour the popular brewery.

The weekly ping-pong tournament at&nbsp;<a href=#>the world's best-themed bar</a>, more formally known as Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room and Ping-Pong Emporium, is perhaps the most rousing weekly table tennis event in Atlanta.

At The Highlander, the dauber makes its grand return as the popular event attracts those interested in combining childhood nostalgia with the adult realities of drinking alone on a Monday at Bingo. Like most bingo-friendly establishments, Pabst Blue Ribbon is available at a discounted price to help serious players get the most from their experience. Though the bingo begins at 9:30 every Monday, the PBR's are $2 all day.</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>&nbsp;»RELATED: The insider's guide to night spots in Atlanta</a><p class=story-text data-index=24><a href=#>The Highlander</a><br>931 Monroe Drive NE<br>404-872-0060</p><p class=story-text data-index=26><b>Magic City Mondays</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=28>The undisputed heavyweight champion of Monday night entertainment in Atlanta is most certainly Magic City Mondays. While in most cases, cultural norms dictate strip club avoidance so early in the week, Magic City Mondays are worthy of exemption. There is perhaps no event in Atlanta more impactful to its respective industry than Magic City Mondays are to hip-hop. Tastemakers, rising stars and icons share in the show with the DJ. The club is open from 3 p.m. until 3 a.m.</p><p class=story-text data-index=29><a href=#>Magic City</a><br>241 Forsyth St. SW<br>404-584-5847</p><p class=story-text data-index=30><b>RECOMMENDED VIDEO: Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room and Ping-Pong Emporium</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e9OhoKefo2KutbjAp6uaZZ2ku6Wt2Giqn7Fjl4Cts62AfrNxg66Ft5DOs32HZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
