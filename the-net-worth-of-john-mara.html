As per sources, John Mara’s overall net worth in early 2016 was estimated to be $500 million.</p><h3>John Mara’s Wealth Reaches $500 Million</h3><p>John Mara is the eldest of 11 children born to Ann and Wellington Mara, with ancestry including Irish, German, French, and Canadian roots. His upbringing was in the White Plains suburb of New York, and he graduated from Iona Preparatory High School in New Rochelle in 1972. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree cum laude in marketing from Boston College in 1976 and later obtained a law degree from Fordham University in 1979.</p><p>John Mara commenced his legal career at the New York law firm Vedder, Price, Kaufman, Kammholz and Day, specializing in labor and employment law and litigation. In 1981, he moved to Shea & Gould in Manhattan, where he remained until 1991. These roles as an attorney formed the basis of his significant net worth.</p><p>John’s ties to the Giants run deep—all the way back to his grandfather Tim Mara, who founded the team in 1925. His father, Wellington, and uncle, Jack, inherited the team in 1959 and led it for 45 years. Wellington Mara was one of NFL’s most respected and influential executives. In 1991, John Mara left his legal career to join the family business, taking on roles at the New York Giants, initially as the General Counsel, and later as the Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer. Following his father’s passing in 2005, John Mara, alongside Steve Tisch, became the co-owner of the team and the third generation of Maras to lead the Giants. He was also appointed the team’s CEO. His involvement in the NFL has been and continues to be the primary source of John Mara’s immense wealth.</p><p>Under John Mara’s leadership, the Giants have made nine playoff appearances, won five NFC East titles, and clinched two of the three Super Bowls in which they have played (in 2008 and 2012).</p><p>In addition to his role with the Giants, John serves as the chairman of the NFL Management Council Executive Committee. Over the past 14 years, he has been a part of the NFL Competition Committee, the Health and Safety Committee, and the league’s Committee on Workplace Diversity.</p><p>On the personal front, John Mara is married to Denise, and together they have a son and four daughters. They reside in New York.</p><p>Despite his demanding career, John Mara is actively involved in charitable causes, serving as a Board Member of Saint Vincent’s Hospital in Harrison, New York, and supporting Boys Hope Girls Hope of New York, an organization that helps academically capable children in need pursue opportunities in college education.</p><p>It’s worth noting that John Mara is the uncle of Academy Award-nominated actress Rooney Mara and her sister Kate Mara, an Emmy Award nominee.</p><p><br>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 1, 1954</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>President, CEO and co-owner of NFL team the New York Giants</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Fordham University, Boston College (1972 – 1976), Jona Preparatory School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Denise W.
