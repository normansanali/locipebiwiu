The pair met when Willie was still married to Matthews, who died from liver failure at age 53 in 1989. Sparks began to fly between Willie and Collie while recording their 1962 duet, “Willingly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Willie-Nelson-2nd-Wife-Found-Out-About-Affair-From-Hospital-Bill-After-His-Mistress-Gave-Birth-3.jpg><p>“The title just about summed up the sexual vibe we felt in the studio,” Willie shared in the docuseries.</p><p>Two years after Willie secretly welcomed baby Paula with Koepke, he and Collie divorced in 1971. He wed Koepke that same year.</p><p>During his marriage to Koepke, Willie began a relationship with makeup artist <strong>Annie D’Angelo</strong>, whom he met on the set of his 1986 film Stagecoach. Willie went on to divorce Koepke in 1988 and exchanged vows with D’Angelo, 67, in 1991. The musician spoke candidly about his three divorces in Willie Nelson & Family.</p><p>“I’ve always said there’s no such thing as a former wife,” Willie said. “Once in your life, a wife never leaves. I regret the pain I caused Connie, and Martha and Shirley before her. I have no excuses. I’d be hard-pressed to define love. I know God’s love is pure, but worldly love is flawed love, and lot’s of times confused love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Willie-Nelson-2nd-Wife-Found-Out-About-Affair-From-Hospital-Bill-After-His-Mistress-Gave-Birth-4.jpg><p>Although the songwriter admitted he “had a gift for complicating things” when it comes to romantic love, he has no regrets about ending up with D’Angelo.</p><p>“Marrying Annie wasn’t complicated at all. It’s about the smartest thing I ever did,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Willie is the dad of eight children: Lana, 70, Susie, 67, and Billy Jr., who died by suicide at age 33 in 1991, all of whom he shared with Matthews; Paula, 54, and Amy, 50, whom he shares with Koepke; Lukas, 34, and Jacob, 33, whom he shares with D’Angelo; and Renee, who died at age 64 in 2012. Willie welcomed Renee with friend Mary Haney but didn’t know she was his child until 2012.</p><p>“I have an old, dear friend, Mary Haney, who I’d lost touch with but recently met again after decades. Turns out, Mary and I had a child together called Renee,” Willie wrote in his 2012 memoir, Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings From the Road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoZyhtqZ5zZ6jrKeeqHqmxIywoJ%2BdXZm2tK%2FOr5yrnZRirqeywKKpZpmWqbKzecyiqq2qlajAbrPAr5xmmpmnwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
