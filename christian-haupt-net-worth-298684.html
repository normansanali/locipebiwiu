When he was two years old, she posted a video of his skills at pitching and hitting that went viral. His brief stardom included a cameo in an Adam Sandler movie and many opportunities to throw opening pitches, especially for his favorite team the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>While his talent with baseball is undeniable and insatiable, everyone's fifteen minutes have to end. Thus, he went six years with little entertainment exposure. In 2017 his mother would write a book alleging that her son was actually the reincarnation of baseball icon Lou Gehrig based on information he gave her as a toddler.</p><p>He's had an impressive career on and off the field as a child. He was the youngest person ever to throw a ceremonial first pitch for the MBA. In 2012 the photograph of him on the mound, mid-throw, concentrating on his form and follow-through became the top sports photo of that year. He continues to play baseball in major throwing positions.</p><p>His mother Cathy Bird is the one who wrote the book about his alleged past-life regressions he experienced as a toddler called The Boy Who Knew Too Much. She worked in sports for most of her career but later would become a full-time Realtor for Coldwell. His parents are divorced and he moved to live with his mother and oldest sister Charlotte.</p><p>Adam Sandler discovered him on YouTube, his mother's page had highlights from his love of sports and cast him to play one of his family members in a scene in his 2011 movie when he was still a toddler.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTnb%2Bqv9OimKdlmJbCscCMp5ytZaekv7W0jGtwcW5oaQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
