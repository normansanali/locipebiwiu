It seemed like the perfect time for Love & Hip Hop to reunite some of its most noteworthy characters for another season of Family Reunion.</p><p>This time, we're seeing a single Mena and Rich reuniting once again, and in a preview, Rich presses up on his ex. We previously reported on some behind-the-scenes clips from this excursion <a href=# rel>as Rich flirted with Erica</a>, but in the snippet, he full-on makes his presence known. Rich tries convincing Mena that she was still in love with him, but according to her, he's the one that wants another shot at love.</p><p>"Honestly, Rich being all over me and stuff, <a href=# rel>I wasn't surprised</a>," she said. "I know deep down inside he's probably regretted not doing right by me... Being with me is like, a moment." She also stated that she wasn't uncomfortable when Rich had his hand on her leg as he admitted that he does love her.
