The producer’s first Netflix series, Ratched, dropped on the streaming giant on Friday, September 18, <a href=#>introducing the world to an entirely new Nurse Ratched</a> — a character featured in the 1975 drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.</p><p>The thrilling drama is dark, twisted and at times, very funny, following the life of <a href=#><strong>Sarah Paulson</strong></a>‘s Ratched, a nurse who cons her way into on a job at a mental hospital. It doesn’t take long for her dark past to be revealed.</p><p>The actress, 45, who has worked with Murphy for years on <a href=#>American Horror Story</a> and American Crime Story, actually didn’t get approached for the role at first.</p><p>“My agent called and said, ‘Is Ryan not talking to you about Ratched?’ I was like, ‘No!’ I called him and he said, ‘I wasn’t sure if it was something you wanted to do. You spent all this time on American Horror Story playing a different character every season. I don’t know if you’re going to want to play the same character season after season,” the Emmy winner told <a href=#>Vogue</a>. “And I was like, <a href=#>‘I might! You could just have asked me.’</a> And then I thought, ‘Why would I want to face-plant in front of the whole world by taking on a character that was made famous by <strong>Louise Fletcher</strong>, who gives an Oscar-winning performance?’ It might be the craziest thing I’ve ever thought about doing and that made it too intriguing to pass up. I’m a glutton for punishment.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Cynthia Nixon</strong></a>, whose character falls in love with Paulson’s devilish nurse, felt the exact opposite. “I’d been hearing about the project for a while and that <a href=#>there were a number of characters</a> that I might be right for. Then, Ryan approached me about playing Gwendolyn,” the 54-year-old said. “She is so ahead of her time. She’s a queer woman and someone who wants not just to be behind the scenes in politics, but also to eventually be the candidate herself. That’s a tall order in this period.”</p><p>Despite her fears, the Glass star dove in and rewatched the film to start. Despite viewing Ratched as “heinous” the first time around, it was different upon rewatching.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was looking for a way to get inside her head and I said, ‘This woman is a victim of a patriarchal infrastructure at this hospital.’ The question is would we have hated the character so much if a man was playing it?” she recalled. “We come up against our own expectations that a woman who is a nurse should be maternal and soft. If not, she’s a villain.”</p><p>For more on Ratched, scroll through the gallery below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BnrrWvx56bZp2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlpKR6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW7Ax55krKyRp3q0wNSdm56cXaOytbLLoq9mq5ikxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
