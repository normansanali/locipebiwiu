Isley began his singing career in church at a young age. When he was a teenager, he joined The Isley Brothers, which included his brothers O’Kelly, Ronnie, and Vernon. Rudolph, Ronald, Vernon, and O’Kelly Isley, Jr. created the Isley Brothers in 1954. Vernon died in 1955, while he was only 13 years old.</p><p>Following Vernon’s death in 1955, The Isley Brothers traveled to New York in search of a recording deal. He recorded and released his first recording, ‘Shout,’ with The Isley Brothers a few years later in 1959. In the 1960s, Isley and his brothers founded the T-Neck Records label to market their records. They relaunched Motown Records after splitting from the label and scored a Grammy-winning hit with ‘It’s Your Thing’ in 1969. When T-Neck was revived, Isley recorded a few lead vocals on numerous Isley Brothers albums while Ron was the principal lead singer.</p><p>Live It Up (1974), The Heat Is On (1975), Harvest for the World (1976), Go for Your Guns (1977), Showdown (1978), and Between the Sheets (1979) are some of The Isley Brothers’ #1 albums (1983). ‘Shout (Part 1),’ ‘This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),’ ‘Love the One You’re With,’ ‘Summer Breeze,’ ‘That Lady (Part 1),’ and others are among the group’s popular songs. They’ve also had four Billboard Top 10 singles in the United States.</p><p>Kelly, Isley’s older brother, died of a heart attack in his sleep in March 1986. Kelly’s death crushed his heart because the two brothers were close. As a result, after recording the albums Smooth Sailin’ and Spend the Night, Isley eventually departed the band and the music industry in 1989. Following that, he went on to become a Christian minister. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and their names were added to Hollywood’s Rockwall in 1997. In 2003, the Isley Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Rudolph_Isley8217s_Bio>Rudolph Isley’s Bio</span></h2><p>Rudolph Bernard Isley was born on April 1, 1939, in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.
