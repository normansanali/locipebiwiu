With Season 39, most cast members are newer to the show, although a few with experience returned.</p><p>However, a post from Challenge insider @GamerVev on Twitter suggested that two of the Ride or Dies rookies may have formed a powerful alliance.</p><p>According to the tweet, Ride or Dies finalist Olivia Kaiser and her friend, <a href=#>Nurys Mateo</a>, have been the main part of this new alliance and might be “running the season.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-challenge-39-alliance-tweet.jpg><p>Several fans commented on GamerVev’s tweet about the alliance, with more than a few suggesting that two-time MTV Challenger, Michele Fitzgerald, was running this alliance.</p><p>Michele appeared in Season 38 with Nurys and Olivia. During the season, Michele and her Ride or Dies partner, Jay Starrett, seemingly had an alliance with some of the rookies, including Johnny Middlebrooks, Ravyn Rochelle, and Nurys Mateo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-challenge-season-39-alliance-boss-rumor.jpg><p>Viewers eventually saw Jay and Michele thrown into elimination by some of their veteran castmates and then defeated by Olivia and Horacio Gutierrez, as various Season 39 cast members yelled helpful suggestions to the rookies.</p><p>Based on Gamer’s replies, Michele isn’t running the Season 39 alliance with Olivia and Nurys. However, PinkRose previously suggested in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vevmo Forum thread</a> that was the case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s been eliminated from Season 39?</h2><p>Based on the latest spoilers at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vevmo</a>, eight cast members are eliminated from Season 39.</p><p>For the men, Ride or Dies rookie Chauncey Palmer was eliminated first, allowing him to return home to his girlfriend <a href=#>Amber Borzotra</a> and their baby daughter.</p><p>Hughie Maughan, who appeared in Spies, Lies & Allies, was the second men’s elimination, followed by MTV newcomers Ciarran Stott (The Challenge: Australia) and Callum Izzard (The Challenge: UK).</p><p>For the women, two newcomers to MTV’s show were the first ones out. The Challenge: Australia’s Jessica Brody and Argentina’s Sofia “Jujuy” Jimenez are both out.</p><p>They were followed by two fan favorites from multiple seasons of MTV’s competition series. Tula “Big T” Fazakerley was revealed as the third woman eliminated after taking some time off. UK reality TV star Melissa Reeves, who returned after multiple seasons away, was the fourth woman out.</p><p>As mentioned, Season 39 has a unique twist. While the initial cast includes players who have never won a final, surprise “mercenaries” are showing up for eliminations, including Tori Deal, <a href=#>Jordan Wiseley</a>, and others.</p><p>Those mercenaries don’t appear to be sticking around after participating in the eliminations, so seeing how things play out in Season 39’s final should be interesting.</p><p>The Challenge Season 39 is TBA for MTV. The Challenge: USA 2 premieres Thursday, August 10 at 10/9c on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm6vx5qjpZ2enLJuv8SaqqimXWiGbr%2FPqKClnaKoerPBzKiprGWjqrSosdKtZKydppq%2ForiMnJisrF2isq6uxKuqZp6fp7qmsIypprCdomKurbjImqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
