This means that athletes can now benefit financially from the use of their name, image and likeness in endorsements, sponsorships, and other financial opportunities. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.nbcsportschicago.com/2023/12/web-231207-CFP-national-championship-2023.jpg alt="College Football Playoff: What expanded 12-team format will look like – NBC Sports Chicago" data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-src="https://media.nbcsportschicago.com/2023/12/web-231207-CFP-national-championship-2023.jpg?quality=85&strip=all" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The NCAA has long been accused of exploiting its athletes, as they are unable to make money from their name, image and likeness while in college. However, recent changes have been made to allow college athletes to take advantage of their NIL.</p><p>In 2021, the NCAA created the “Student-Athlete Opportunity Act”, which allows college athletes to generate income from their NIL. The NCAA also created a set of rules that restrict how athletes can use their NIL. For example, athletes are not allowed to endorse alcohol, tobacco, or gambling-related products. Additionally, athletes are not allowed to be paid for endorsements or sponsorships from outside sources, such as agents or apparel companies.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncaa.com/_flysystem/public-s3/styles/large_16x9/public-s3/images/2023-12/Idaho-Football.jpg alt="FCS College Football - Home | NCAA.com" data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-src="https://www.ncaa.com/_flysystem/public-s3/styles/large_16x9/public-s3/images/2023-12/Idaho-Football.jpg?h=cdcda3e1&itok=lssL8MlO" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While the NCAA has made some progress in allowing college athletes to benefit from their NIL, there is still much more that needs to be done. For example, the NCAA has yet to create rules governing third-party companies that are attempting to monetize athletes’ NIL. Additionally, there is still much debate over how much athletes should be allowed to make from their NIL.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1206/r1262912_1296x518_5-2.jpg alt="Oregon State Beavers Scores, Stats and Highlights - ESPN" data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-src=https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2023/1206/r1262912_1296x518_5-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>NIL has become an important topic in college football as it is seen as a way to give athletes more control over their careers, and to help them benefit financially from their hard work and dedication. With the NCAA’s recent changes, college athletes now have the opportunity to make money from the use of their name, image and likeness, which was previously not allowed. While there is still much to be done, these changes are a step in the right direction towards fair compensation for college athletes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ7AbrrIpWSipl2YvK24xKCcZp6fpMGjrcul</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
