Jalen Hurts, ill ahead of the match-up, suddenly looks to have had a change of heart and might grace the Lumen Field. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Hurts</a> showed up as DNP for Saturday ahead of this game and it was unclear whether he would be playing against the Seahawks. The Eagles, though 10-3, cannot afford to lose this game if they want to maintain their dominant position for the playoff berth.</p><p>The QB came to the Seahawks’ facility in style, reminding us of Michael Jordan for a specific reason. Meanwhile, Hurts’ playing status has been fluctuating continuously, amidst which he traveled to Seattle alone so that his teammates don’t get sick ahead of this important away game. Now, the new update surrounding the QB has the Eagles’ supporters on their feet.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Jalen Hurts surprise return against the Seahawks?</strong></h2><p>A tweet from CBS’ John Clark is doing numbers on Twitter (formerly X) and gives us an assurance that Hurts will be playing the game. He was spotted in the facility wearing his Jordan gear and a duffle bag in his hand. Hurts showed up in utter style wearing a white and black combination, gaining comments of anticipation from everyone around on his match presence. In his tweet, Clark writes, “Jalen is wearing his Jordan gear. Michael Jordan flu game?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Source confirms that Jalen Hurts will play tonight through an illness he has battled over the weekend</p><p>Jalen is wearing his Jordan gear. Michael Jordan flu game?<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZfImKyYt9I</a></p><p>— John Clark (@JClarkNBCS) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></p><p>The question of comparison to the NBA legend reminds the sports world of Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals, when Jordan was down with flu, yet decided to play for the sake of his team. It seems like a valid reasoning here for Hurts as well because the Eagles cannot afford to lose after taking back-to-back hits from the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Niners</a> and the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Cowboys</a>&nbsp;and having their QB on the field would be a greater boost than ever.</p><p>Also, they are on a two-game losing streak and their PCT will take a hit if they lose this game, putting their playoff dreams in jeopardy. Hopes remain high as playing through an illness is nothing new to him. He managed to play in an MNF against the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Buccaneers</a> in the past while being sick. Though Jalen Hurts looks to be giving it a go this time around as well, is he healthy enough to get his team the win?</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nfl-active-news-patrick-mahomes-signs-endorsement-deal-with-logan-pauls-prime-beverages?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1255672682-473x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Patrick Mahomes Signs Endorsement Deal With Logan Paul’s&nbsp;Prime&nbsp;Beverages</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Hurts takes one for the team!</strong></h2><p>Till Sunday morning, Hurts was listed as questionable to play because of a flu-like sickness. He didn’t show up to practice on Friday and Saturday because of his sickness and it became worse by Sunday, making him fall under the questionable to-play category. Fortunately for Hurts, the game was flexed from SNF to MNF, and it might give Jalen Hurts some time to recover.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1024243003h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Eagles are at the top of their division at the moment. However, the stats indicate a decline in the play of the team along with their QB. About this, Hurts had 7.70 YPA and 7.50 Air Yards Per Attempt in the first 9 games of the season, however, that dropped to 6.76 YPA and 6.68 AYPA in the last 4 games he’s played.</p><p>While the QB has conditioned himself for tough times and might come out to play against the Seahawks, will the performance be up to the expectations? Questions continue to surround the Eagles before the game.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Amid Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce engagement rumors, speculations emerge, foreshadowing a gloomy end</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2aZk6m2t7GMp5ywq12frq2xzWafrqqkqHq0tM6wqmatoGLBsHnToZxmnZGcuaa%2FjK%2BqZquVlrWiw8qsZJykkai1brXNZqGoqpSWu26zxJqpZpmWqbKzecGeoKefXZm8uLrGq5idnZRisbaxjK2mZqGcobumv9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
