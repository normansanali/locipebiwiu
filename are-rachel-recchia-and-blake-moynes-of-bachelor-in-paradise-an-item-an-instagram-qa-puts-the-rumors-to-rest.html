Unfortunately, things quickly took a turn as soon as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercedes Northup</a> became a single woman, with Jordan deciding to shoot his shot, ultimately causing the Iowa native to give him her rose as soon as the rose ceremony rolled around.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Because of this, Rachel was stunned, running out of the rose ceremony and into the arms of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Palmer</a>, sharing with the host that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she wanted to leave the show once and for all</a>. “I think I might need to go. When I came down those steps, I told myself if there was a point where I knew I needed to go, I would go… It’s going to be so hard but I think I know that this is that moment,” she tearfully spilled.</p><p data-characters=618 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>As for Blake, he pursued a relationship with Jess Girod during his time on Bachelor In Paradise season 9 — even though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she is 24 years old</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he is 33 years old</a> — however, after determining that his relationship with Jess was nowhere near where it should have been with the highly-anticipated finale approaching, the pair went their separate ways. “I feel like I’ve had a taste of what love is here, and I feel like we’re not getting there at all… As much as we want this to work, it’s not going to,” Blake told Jess, resulting in the Canada native’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">self-elimination</a> from the show.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Now, both being single, Rachel and Blake have had some suspicious social media activity that has caused fans of the franchise to speculate as to whether or not they are an item. Needless to say, our fingers are crossed!</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, the Chicago native set the record straight during a Q&A via Instagram.

What a journey it was trying to find and get to know the critically endangered Kemp’s Ridley&nbsp;🐢&nbsp;(we got to meet the Green Turtle & Loggerhead too!)

Join in on the important work and fun — get your own sea turtle bracelet and track your own turtle just like the Kemps Ridley here!”</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Naturally, fans of The Bachelor franchise took to the comment section to ship Rachel and Blake with one another.</p><p>“Team <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@blakemoynes</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@pilot.rachel</a>“</p><p>“I have been kind of hoping for Rachel & Blake 😭😭”</p><p>“Me secretly hoping Blake & Rachel end up together 🤭”</p><p>“Can you and Blake just date already and get married 😍”</p><p>“So whats the scoop with you and Rachel?? We all need to know. You would make a great couple!”</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Because of this, Rachel received dozens and dozens of questions regarding her relationship with Blake in a recent Q&A via Instagram, where she put the rumors to rest, sharing a photo of the two of them with the caption “He’s still sick of dealing with me” as a response.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=false>Neither confirming nor denying their connection, will a relationship between Rachel and Blake blossom someday? It is safe to say we will be keeping up with both Bachelor Nation bombshells on Instagram until further notice to find out for ourselves…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmqZqbmJq5br7EnJqhoZFirq%2BwjJujmqOVYrqwxc2eqmanlmKvoq%2FHnqOoql2eu268wKuYnaGjmnqiuoyiq56lXZa7brXNrKuan6KWum69wGanrqyjYsGpsYyrrKanoqh6tbuMq5ysrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
