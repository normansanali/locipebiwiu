"Not easy taking a selfie jet skiing," wrote the 33-year-old, who had tied her wet locks back into a high bun and has her eyes closed against the sea spray. North's mum also made sure she made the most of the sun, soaking up the rays as she enjoyed a siesta. "Let me sleep!!!!" she captioned a photograph of herself lying back in a bikini on a sunlounger.</p><p id=ekQTuxScVe88 data-wc=61>At the end of the relaxing day at Casa Aramara, which is nestled amid acres of lush tropical gardens along the beach, the pair enjoyed some downtime together. Kim shared a snap of the duo with her fans, showing herself and her hubby against a beautiful nighttime backdrop of a lit-up pool and the beach in the distance. "#MexicoNightsWithMySexyMan," tweeted Kim.</p><p id=eW_iZqpspEZo data-wc=50>Casa Aramara is a long-time favourite of the couple, as well as the rest of the Kardashian-Jenners.
