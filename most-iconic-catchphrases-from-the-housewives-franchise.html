The former beauty queen's iconic catchphrase went so viral even <a href=#>Beyoncé was seen</a> saying it. The quote originated during Season 5 of "RHOA" during a girls' trip to Anguilla when Moore and her castmate Porsha Williams got into a blowout argument. Williams confronted Moore over her attitude while attending one of Williams' grandfather's charity events, <a href=#>telling Moore</a>,&nbsp;"You just act like nothing was good enough for you, and you seemed like you were bigger than the event."</p><p>Moore denied the accusations, and the argument escalated when Williams said Kenya was a "nonfactor" to her and commented on her age. The verbal altercation nearly turned physical before cast member NeNe Leakes stepped in to separate the women. But it wasn't over until Moore twirled and <a href=#>delivered</a>&nbsp;the fateful phrase, "I'm still fabulous, right? Fabulous, 'Gone with the Wind' fabulous, okay?"</p><p>While the phrase is iconic, Moore revealed it had an even deeper meaning than viewers might think. On her <a href=#>Bravo</a> blog, Moore explained that she was inspired by actor Hattie McDaniel who starred in "Gone with the Wind" and was the first Black woman to take home an Oscar. "Hattie was widely criticized for playing a maid, but without her inner strength, it's unclear what our legacy as a people would be now. Certainly, she has enriched my life. Her incredible feat defied racism, hatred, segregation and civil uncertainty and unrest," Moore wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmbH51fo6mpqysXZ6wsLrInGScmaSYtbG00Zqqnqtdm7%2BwuYytn55lmKTCtLHWoq2eq12bv6K6wqGgrJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
