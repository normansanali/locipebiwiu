One fawning fan likened DC’s poaching of the Guardians of the Galaxy filmmaker from Marvel to the MCU stealing Batman, to which Gunn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">graciously and humbly accepted</a> the comparison to the heavyweight superhero. Let’s hope it doesn’t go to his head, though, as he does now have the power to fire Pattinson and cast himself in The Batman 2.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>30 years later, the reason Terminator 2 had 16 times the budget of the first one is finally clear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/terminator-2-judgement-day.jpg><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>Everyone knows that the Terminator series is less of a franchise and more two fantastic films followed by several underwhelming sequels. While the first one was a low-budget sci-fi/horror, it was Judgement Day that transformed it into an action blockbuster brand, thanks to a enormously increased budget. And now we know why it was so huge, thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a resurfaced bit of trivia</a> revealing that the movie’s future-set opening scene cost more than the entire original movie put together.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Streaming spotlight: An enlightening high-concept thriller that squandered its premise is nevertheless taking flight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-22-2017.jpg><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>There’s nothing more frustrating for film fans than when a movie sports a brilliant premise but fails to capitalize on it. That’s the case with 2017’s 2:22, starring Michiel Huisman and Teresa Palmer, about an air traffic controller who is plagued by the same star-filled vision every day at the exact same time. Despite its lackluster execution, it seems this intriguing mystery is enough to get people to give the flick a go as 2:22 is currently finding itself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking off on streaming this week</a>.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>Stay tuned tomorrow for more of the latest sci-fi news around, cinephiles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uaq56rpGLApLWMn6BmppWswG62wKacrGWXqruvecCdpKKso2K1pr%2BMnZqsZaKarq15y6KdnmWSlsGurc1mmKxloqSvpr7TZqearKSeu7S7zWaeqKGenHq0tMirq6Wdo6h6qrrCoqueq12arrO42GamrJuRp3q1rcukZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
