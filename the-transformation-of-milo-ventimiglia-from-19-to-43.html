He didn't land that role either, but he didn't give up. Ventimiglia did a program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and then moved to Los Angeles. He landed some television commercials, his first being for Dr. Pepper.</p><p dir=ltr>After a string of commercials, Ventimiglia landed his first television gig, playing "Party Guest 1" on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." Ventimiglia attended UCLA as he auditioned for roles, and he said that one-line part on "Fresh Prince" left him "stoked." As his <a href=#>IMDb</a> page detailed, he landed numerous one-off acting roles consistently from there. He appeared on "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" (seen above), as well as "Saved by the Bell: The New Class," among many others.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Men's Journal</a> noted Ventimiglia dropped out of UCLA once he consistently landed acting jobs. He still struggled to convince people to cast him though. He was often told he looked too young, he told People, and his crooked mouth prompted comments too. Ventimiglia explained his crooked mouth was caused by "dead nerves" he had when he was born. In early auditions, "They'd be like: 'Could you stop doing that thing with your mouth where your lip is going down?'" he shared. At this point, he admits, "I mean, look, I can't get away from it now. It's who I am, you know? I've got a crooked mouth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxkbYNxe9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWakoqSfYsOmutOipKKfnJ6ubrLRqKRmaWliwbB5k2xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
