Lea Michele and her boyfriend, Matthew Paetz, have split after nearly two years of dating, a source confirms to Us Weekly. 
The insider tells Us that Michele and her hunky model beau broke up earlier this month, and she was absolutely heartbroken. &#34;He had enough,&#34; the insider tells Us. &#34;She was completely crushed.&#34; 
And the odds for reconciliation are zero. &#34;He won't take her back,&#34; the source adds.
The Scream Queens actress, 29, first met Paetz on the set of her music video &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"He had enough," the insider tells <i>Us</i>. "She was completely crushed."&nbsp;</p><p>And the odds for reconciliation are zero. "He won't take her back," the source adds.</p><p><span>The <i>Scream Queens</i> actress, 29, <a href=#>first met Paetz on the set of her music video</a> "On My Way" in April 2014. The costars immediately hit it off and were soon photographed together on steamy vacations and adorable date nights.&nbsp;</span><span>The split is somewhat surprising given that Michele was all about the romance in a podcast interview last month.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"She was completely blindsided," the source tells </span><i>Us</i><span> of the split. In January, t</span><span>he</span><i> Glee</i><span> alum opened up on PodcastOne's <i>Fempire</i> show about how her late boyfriend, </span><span>Cory Monteith</span><span>,</span><span> would have approved.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"We’ve stood by each other through anything that was thrown our way, and [Matt] is a such a great man that he would never really let anything like that ever crack our lovely little core that we've created," Michele gushed at the time. "And, you know, he is also very respectful toward the person that I was with, and that, again, is something I love so much about him."</span></p><p>In fact, Monteith — who tragically died at age 31 from a combination of alcohol and heroin overdose in 2013 — would've thought the same.&nbsp;</p><p><span>"I really know that Cory would love him too," Michele claimed. "And that’s all that we hold within our hearts, and so does everyone else in my life. Other people don’t know him and they don't know my private life, so I understand that people are going to say whatever they are going to say. As long and he and I are good, my family’s good, my friends are good, that’s all that matters."</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZFiuqqvx56jnmWjpbmqwNJmnaunnWKvsMXFq6CeppRiuqLA06GcsGWglrK1xoyana2domLBuLuMspyaqqNixHKClGlna2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
