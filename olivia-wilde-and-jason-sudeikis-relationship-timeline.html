During a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the Horrible Bosses star dished on his first interaction with Wilde.
“I actually came off looking a lot cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends that weren’t exactly her best girlfriends, that would report back, ‘Oh, you know, I think she’s dating someone,’ so I didn’t make any sort of moves,” he recalled at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I felt I had something to prove,” she explained at the time. “If you fall off a horse, you get back up. I am not a quitter. I hung on for as long as possible, until it was more hurtful to stay.”</p><p>Wilde continued, “I’m so grateful for the pain and the heartbreak. It gave me the courage to leave and brought me to the great love of my life.”</p><p>The Tron: Legacy star also told the publication that she <a href=#>wasn’t necessarily looking for love</a> when she first met Sudeikis, adding, “I was just learning to be by myself; I’d been divorced nine months. We were both seeing people but were single. He seemed to really see me, see through the bulls–t.”</p><p>Wilde and Sudeikis announced their engagement in 2013. They are now <a href=#>parents of son Otis and daughter Daisy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Net-a-Porter’s <a href=#>Porter Edit</a> in February 2016, Wilde explained how she believed becoming a parent alongside Sudeikis was a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot.</p><p>“We are seriously connected,” she said. “Before you have a child, <a href=#>marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise</a> to one another, and then once you have a child, it’s like, ‘Oh, we’re committed and promised already.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in November 2020 that the longtime couple’s romance came to an end.</p><p>Scroll down to see a complete timeline of Wilde and Sudeikis’ romance throughout the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvK211aKYZq%2BZobGmecCnm2aikai8r3nSrpueoZuewG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
