On the back of a mid-level budget that ranged from $38-54 million, the film made only $109.9 million at the global box office. Combined with that, it was faced with harsh reviews and on Rotten Tomatoes, it sports an embarrassingly low score of just 15%.</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=false>“With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian&nbsp;YA&nbsp;sci-fi films,&nbsp;<i>The 5th Wave</i> ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle,” is how RT’s Critics Consensus scathingly puts it. But, as we’ve seen many times before, what sunk in theaters often enjoys renewed success on <strong>Netflix</strong> as folks are less demanding with their time when they’re on their own couch. And in this case, it seems subscribers are happy to give over a couple of hours to The 5th Wave. Whether they end up enjoying it or not, though, is another question entirely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaiql6TBtbHNZqqcoZaeeq671aKcZpyforavrdOipaBlnprBp7jIsWStp5SWxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
