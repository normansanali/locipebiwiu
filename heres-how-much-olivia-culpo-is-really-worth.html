It turns out that she's worth $7 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;With that fortune, Culpo can enjoy a posh life that includes her <a href=#>"loft-style condo in Hollywood"</a> which she snapped up in 2017 for $1.1 million, per CNW. She then upgraded her living situation in 2019 when she <a href=#>dropped $3.5 million on a home in Encino, Calif.</a>, which spans 5,141 square feet.&nbsp;What else does Culpo spend her money on? Well, according to her Instagram account, she likes to take <a href=#>dreamy vacations</a>&nbsp;to tropical locations, <a href=#>ride around (or pose) in luxe vehicles</a>, and <a href=#>show off her expensive accessories</a>.</p><p>Frankly, Culpo is an example of reaching your goal. "I dreamed about being comfortable on my own someday," she told InStyle in 2018. Beyond that, she admitted that it "was scary to think about potentially having a lack of money or things that I needed to survive in life — obviously that's always a nightmare when you're younger." And yet, she said she "also saw how hard [her] parents worked every day, so they set a really great example." She explained, "They taught me that nothing was going to just fall right into my lap, and that I had to work in order to get the things that I wanted." And it seems like she did just that!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25paoJ6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZ%2Bhtre1wGaarqSgpHqqv4yrnJqknK56uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
